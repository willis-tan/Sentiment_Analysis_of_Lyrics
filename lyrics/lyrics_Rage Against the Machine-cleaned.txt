with the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
of the power dons, that five-sided fistagon
the rotten sore on the face of mother earth gets bigger
the trigger’s cold, empty your purse

hoover, he was a body remover
i'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
to the rage built up inside of me
fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
movements come and movements go
leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
departments of police, (what!) the judges (what!), the feds
networks at work, keeping people calm
you know they went after king when he spoke out on vietnam
he turned the power to the have-nots
and then came the shot
yeah
yeah, back in this
with poetry my mind i flex
"flip" like wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
what do i got to, what do i got to do to wake you up?
to shake you up, to break the structure up?
'cause blood still flows in the gutter
i'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
set the groove, then stick and move like i was cassius
rep the "stutter step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
yeah, several federal men
who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
you better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
networks at work, keepin' people calm
ya know they murdered x and tried to blame it on islam
he turned the power to the have-nots
and then came the shot
what was the price on his head?

or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
yes a spectacle, monopolized
they hold the reins, stole your eyes
all the fistagons, the bullets and bombs
who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks

in the right light, study becomes insight
but the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
so-called facts are fraud
they want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
lost the culture, the culture lost
spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
yo, we gotta take the power back
bam, here's the plan
motherfuck uncle sam, step back, i know who i am
raise up your ear, i'll drop the style and clear

we need a movement with a quickness
you are the witness of change and to counteract
we gotta take the power back

the present curriculum, i put my fist in 'em
eurocentric, every last one of 'em
see right through the red, white, and blue disguise
with lecture i puncture the structure of lies
installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
we've got to take it back
holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
one-sided stories for years and years and years
i'm inferior? who's inferior?
yeah, we need to check the interior
of the system that cares about only one culture
and that, is why we gotta take the power back
yeah, we gotta take the power back

the teacher stands in front of the class
but the lesson plan he can't recall
the student's eyes don't perceive the lies
bouncing off every fucking wall
his composure is well kept
i guess he fears playing the fool
the complacent students sit
and listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
europe ain't my rope to swing on
can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(gotta get it, gotta get it together then
like the motherfuckin' weathermen)
expose and close the doors on those who try
to strangle and mangle the truth
'cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
we gotta take the power back
yeah, we gotta take the power back
come on, come on

mama's torn hands cover her sunken face
we hungry but them belly full
the structure is set, ya never change it with a ballot pull

schoolyard to precinct, suburb to project block
bosses rode south for new flesh and a factory floor
the remains left chained to the powder war
can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
so make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first

there's a bank, there's a church, a myth and a hearse
a mall and a loan, a child dead at birth
there's a widow pig parrot, a rebel to tame
a white-hooded judge, a syringe and a vein
and the riot be the rhyme of the unheard
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?

pick a point here at home, yes, the picture's the same
there's a field full of slaves, some corn and some debt
there's a ditch full of bodies, the check for the rent
there's a tap, the phone, the silence of stone
the numb black screen that be feelin' like home
and the riot be the rhyme of the unheard
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?
what you say, what you say, what you say, what?

silence, something about silence makes me sick
'cause silence can be violent sorta like a slit wrist
if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
but if ya bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
some speak the sounds but speak in silent voices
like radio is silent though it fills the air with noises
its transmissions bring submission as ya mold to the unreal
and mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
yeah
and mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
with a fistful of steel
('cause i know the power of the question)
with a fistful of steel

it's time to flow like the fluid in ya veins
if ya will it, i will spill it and ya out
just as quick as ya came
not a silent one, but a defiant one
never a normal one 'cause i'm the bastard son
with the visions of the move, vocals not to soothe
but to ignite and put in flight my sense of militance
groovin', playin' that game called survival
the status, the elite, the enemy, the rival
the silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'
give you a glimpse of the reality i'm grippin'
steppin' into the jam and i'm slammin' like shaquille
mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
yeah
and mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel

a stare full of nails
the roulette ball

but if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
yeah

the main attraction, distraction
got ya number than number than numb
empty ya pockets, son, they got you thinkin' that
what ya need is what they selling
make you think that buying is rebelling
from the theaters to malls on every shore
the thin line between entertainment and war
the frontline is everywhere, there be no shelter here
spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
memories erased, burned and scarred
trade in ya history for a vcr
cinema, simulated life, ill drama
fourth reich culture, americana
chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
the thin line between entertainment and war
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
hospitals not profit full
the market bulls got pockets full
to advertise some hip disguise
view the world from american eyes
the poor adore, keep fiendin' for more
the thin line between entertainment and war
they fix the need, develop the taste
buy their products or get laid to waste
coca-cola is back in the veins of saigon
and rambo too, he's got a dope pair of nikes on
and godzilla, pure mothafuckin' filler
to keep ya eyes off the real killer

a jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
a world of violent rage but it's one that i can recognize
having never seen the color of my father's eyes
yes, i dwell in hell, but it's a hell that i can grip
i tried to grip my family but i slipped
to escape from the pain in an existence mundane
i got a nine, a sign, a set, and now i got a name
read my writing on the wall
no one's here to catch me when i fall
death is on my side

born of a broken man, but not a broken man
born of a broken man, never a broken man
born of a broken man, but not a broken man
born of a broken man, never a broken man
like autumn leaves his sense fell from him
an empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within
his thoughts like a hundred moths
trapped in a lampshade
somewhere within
their wings banging and burning
on through endless night
forever awake he lies shaking and starving
praying for someone to turn off the light
born of a broken man, never a broken man

the sun ablaze as maria's foot touches the surface of sand
on northern land, as human contraband
some rico from jalisco passed her name to the boss
she stuffed into a truckbed, she clutches her cross
here comes the exhaust and it rips through her lungs
she's off fast to the pasture, like cattle she'll cross
degree 106, sweat and vomit are thrown
and she prays and suffocates upon the memories of home
of yanqui guns for blood, debts on the loans
of smoldering fields, rape, rubble and bones
of graves hidden, trapped up in visions of war
of nothing, no one, nobody, no more
these are her mountains and skies and she radiates
through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
and like the sun disappears only to reappear
she's eternally here
her time is near
never conquered but here
to tear away at the mask
and now she got a quota, the needle and thread crucifixion
sold and shipped across the new line of mason dixon
rippin' through denim, the point an inch from her vein
the foreman approach, his steps now pound in her brain
his presence, it terrifies and eclipses her days
no minutes to rest, no moments to pray
and with a whisper he whips her, her soul chained to his will
"my job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"
her arms jerk, the sisters gather 'round her and scream
as if in a dream, eyes on the crimson stream
numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to the floor
i am nothing, no one, nobody, no more
these are her mountains and skies and she radiates
through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
and like the sun disappears only to reappear (maria)
she's eternally here
her time is near
never conquered but here
to tear away at the mask
away at the mask
to tear away at the mask
no minutes to rest
no moment to pray
no minutes to rest
no moment to pray
no minutes to rest
it eclipses her day
just a moment to pray
to tear away at the mask
away at the mask
to tear away at the mask
to tear away at the mask
his spit is worth more than her work
pass the purse to the pugilists
he's a prize-fighter

a mass of hands press on the market window
ghosts of progress dressed in slow death
feeding on hunger and glaring through the promise
upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle
a mass of nameless at the oasis
that hides the graves beneath the master's hill
buried for drinking the river's water while
shackled to the the line at the empty well
this is the new sound, just like the old sound
just like the noose wound over the new ground
this is the new sound, just like the old sound
just like the noose wound over new ground
listen to the fascist sing
"take hope here, war is elsewhere
you were chosen, this is god's land
soon we'll be free of blot and mixture
seeds planted by our forefathers' hand"
a mass of promises begin to rupture
like the pockets of the new world kings
like swollen stomachs in appalachia
like the priest that fucked you as he whispered holy things
a mass of tears have transformed the stones now
sharpened on suffering and woven into the slings
hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
taking today what tomorrow never brings
this is the new sound, just like the old sound
just like the noose wound over the new ground

ain't it funny how the factory's doors close?
'round the time that the school doors close?
'round the time that the doors of the jail cells
open up to greet you like the reaper?

the spirit of jackson now screams through the ruins
through factory chains and the ghost of the union
the forgotten remains disappear to their new homes
the knife, the thrust, the life burns to the raw bone
the blood on the floor of the tear is still dryin'
cover the spread sheets, the dow jones skyin'
the cell block live stock, the bodies they buyin'
old south order, new northern horizon!

peering into the eyes of the child already on trial
these armies rippin' families apart, get 'em on file
convictions fit the stock profile all the while
films of dogs, cuttin' through homes
ripping skin from bones, yes, the new millennium homes
privatizing through private eyes, an era rising

man walks along the railroad track
he's goin' some place, there's no turnin' back
the highway patrol chopper comin' up, over the ridge
man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
the shelter line stretchin' around the corner
welcome to the new world order
families sleepin' in their cars out in the southwest
no job, no hope, no peace, no rest, no rest
and the highway is alive tonight
nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
i'm sitting down here in the campfire light
searchin' for the ghost pf tom joad
he pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
the preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
he's waitin' for the time when the "last shall be first, and the first shall be last"
in a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
with a one way ticket to the promised ;and
with a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
bathin' in the cities' aqueducts
and the highway is alive tonight
nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
i'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
with the ghost of old tom joad
now tom said, "ma
whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
wherever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
look for me, ma', i'll be there
wherever somebody's strugglin' for a place to stand
for a decent job or a helpin' hand
wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
look in their eyes, ma, you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me

yo, i was a fiend before i became a teen
i melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
shot grabbed the mic and try to say, "yes y'all!"
they tried to take it, and say that i'm too small
cool, 'cause i don't get upset
i kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then i jet
back to the lab, without a mic to grab
so then i add all the rhymes i had
one after the another one, then i make another one
to diss the opposite then ask if the brother's done
i get a craving like i fiend for nicotine
but i don't need a cigarette, know what i mean?
i'm raging, ripping up the stage and
don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
thought of, cause it's sort of an addiction
magnetized by the mixing

'cause i take it to the maximum, i can't relax see, i'm
hype as a hypochrondriac 'cause the rap be one

the hills find peace, locked armed guard posts
safe from the screams of the children born as ghosts
gates, guns and alarms shape the calm of the dawn
peering down into the basin where death lives on
when young run foaming at the mouth with hate
when burning batons beat the freezing who shake
under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
of walls deny the terror faced
by the children born as ghosts
born as ghosts
(a warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
born as ghosts
(a warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)

one book and forty ghosts stuffed in a room
ah, the school as a tomb
where home is a wasteland, taste the razor wire
and thought is locked in the womb
the tales that tear at the myth of the dream
(myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
a suffering that shocks the lives off the screen
(myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
born as ghosts

greed!
causing innocent blood to flow
entire culture, lost in the overthrow
they came to seize and take whatever they please
then all they gave back was death and disease
my people were left with no choice but to decide
to conform to a system, responsible for genocide
responsible for genocide
responsible for genocide
aids is killing the entire african nation
and a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
but these governments, they don't mind their procrastination
they say, "we'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation."
my people's culture was strong, it was pure
and if not for that white greed, it would've endured
my people were left with no choice but to decide
to conform to a system
their minds enslaved, their souls encaged
i feel the rage, it's brutality can never be undone
but the sun is not yet set
the bass and drums and microphones a threat
that's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside
and see that they're responsible for genocide
responsible for genocide
responsible for genocide
ya cram ya culture down my throat
say i'm inferior when i find it i choke
you fill my mind with a false sense of history
and then you wonder why i have no identity?
well, i'll strike a match and it'll catch and
spread the insight we need
a tiny fire, burning bright
shedding light on the darkness of greed
a yes yes y'all
and ya don't stop
shedding light on the darkness of greed
a yes yes y'all
and ya don't stop
shedding light on the darkness of greed
yeah

it's nice to be alive
wonderful people everywhere
the way they comb their hair
makes me want to say
"it's a wonderful place

forced to sit with coplicity in front of my executioners
as they blugeoned me with their so called superior values and demanded my submission
i bacame an indentured servant in a factory

whos' useful quality was to protect their palaces
every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me
so that every thought i express
shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks
and set fire to their homes

rep the "stutter step" then bomb a left upon the fascists

you better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors

now check this out, uh
in the right light, study becomes insight
but the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
so-called facts are fraud
they want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
lost the culture, the culture lost
spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
yo, we gotta take the power back
bam, here's the plan
motherfuck uncle sam, step back, i know who i am
raise up your ear, i'll drop the style and clear
it's the beats and the lyrics they fear
the rage is relentless
we need a movement with a quickness
you are the witness of change and to counteract
we gotta take the power back
yeah, we gotta take the power back
come on, come on
we gotta take the power back
the present curriculum, i put my fist in 'em
eurocentric, every last one of 'em
see right through the red, white, and blue disguise
with lecture i puncture the structure of lies
installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
we've got to take it back
holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
one-sided stories for years and years and years
i'm inferior? who's inferior?
yeah, we need to check the interior
of the system that cares about only one culture
and that, is why we gotta take the power back
yeah, we gotta take the power back
come on, come on
we gotta take the power back
ayo check, we're gonna have to break it, break it, break it down
aw shit
and like this
uh!
come on
yeah
bring it back the other way
uh
the teacher stands in front of the class
but the lesson plan he can't recall
the student's eyes don't perceive the lies
bouncing off every fucking wall
his composure is well kept
i guess he fears playing the fool
the complacent students sit
and listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
europe ain't my rope to swing on
can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(gotta get it, gotta get it together then
like the motherfuckin' weathermen)
expose and close the doors on those who try
to strangle and mangle the truth
'cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react

pick a point here at home, yes, the picture's the same
there's a field full of slaves, some corn and some debt

the numb black screen that be feelin' like home

its transmissions bring submission as ya mold to the unreal

if ya will it, i will spill it and ya out
just as quick as ya came
not a silent one, but a defiant one
never a normal one 'cause i'm the bastard son
with the visions of the move, vocals not to soothe
but to ignite and put in flight my sense of militance
groovin', playin' that game called survival
the status, the elite, the enemy, the rival
the silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'
give you a glimpse of the reality i'm grippin'
steppin' into the jam and i'm slammin' like shaquille
mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
yeah

empty ya pockets, son, they got you thinkin' that
what ya need is what they selling
make you think that buying is rebelling
from the theaters to malls on every shore
the thin line between entertainment and war
the frontline is everywhere, there be no shelter here
spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
memories erased, burned and scarred
trade in ya history for a vcr
cinema, simulated life, ill drama
fourth reich culture, americana
chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
the thin line between entertainment and war
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)

there be no shelter here (the frontline is everywhere)
hospitals not profit full
the market bulls got pockets full
to advertise some hip disguise

the poor adore, keep fiendin' for more
the thin line between entertainment and war
they fix the need, develop the taste
buy their products or get laid to waste
coca-cola is back in the veins of saigon

a jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
a world of violent rage but it's one that i can recognize
having never seen the color of my father's eyes
yes, i dwell in hell, but it's a hell that i can grip
i tried to grip my family but i slipped
to escape from the pain in an existence mundane
i got a nine, a sign, a set, and now i got a name

the sun ablaze as maria's foot touches the surface of sand
on northern land, as human contraband
some rico from jalisco passed her name to the boss
she stuffed into a truckbed, she clutches her cross
here comes the exhaust and it rips through her lungs
she's off fast to the pasture, like cattle she'll cross
degree 106, sweat and vomit are thrown
and she prays and suffocates upon the memories of home
of yanqui guns for blood, debts on the loans
of smoldering fields, rape, rubble and bones
of graves hidden, trapped up in visions of war
of nothing, no one, nobody, no more
these are her mountains and skies and she radiates
through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
and like the sun disappears only to reappear
she's eternally here
her time is near
never conquered but here
to tear away at the mask
and now she got a quota, the needle and thread crucifixion
sold and shipped across the new line of mason dixon
rippin' through denim, the point an inch from her vein
the foreman approach, his steps now pound in her brain
his presence, it terrifies and eclipses her days
no minutes to rest, no moments to pray
and with a whisper he whips her, her soul chained to his will
"my job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"
her arms jerk, the sisters gather 'round her and scream
as if in a dream, eyes on the crimson stream
numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to the floor
i am nothing, no one, nobody, no more
these are her mountains and skies and she radiates
through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
and like the sun disappears only to reappear (maria)
she's eternally here
her time is near
never conquered but here
to tear away at the mask
away at the mask
to tear away at the mask
no minutes to rest
no moment to pray
no minutes to rest
no moment to pray
no minutes to rest
it eclipses her day
just a moment to pray
to tear away at the mask
away at the mask
to tear away at the mask
to tear away at the mask
his spit is worth more than her work
pass the purse to the pugilists
he's a prize-fighter
and he bought rings and he owns kin
and now he's swinging
and now he's the champion

a mass of hands press on the market window
ghosts of progress dressed in slow death
feeding on hunger and glaring through the promise
upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle
a mass of nameless at the oasis
that hides the graves beneath the master's hill
buried for drinking the river's water while
shackled to the the line at the empty well
this is the new sound, just like the old sound
just like the noose wound over the new ground
this is the new sound, just like the old sound
just like the noose wound over new ground
listen to the fascist sing
"take hope here, war is elsewhere
you were chosen, this is god's land
soon we'll be free of blot and mixture
seeds planted by our forefathers' hand"
a mass of promises begin to rupture
like the pockets of the new world kings
like swollen stomachs in appalachia
like the priest that fucked you as he whispered holy things
a mass of tears have transformed the stones now
sharpened on suffering and woven into the slings
hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
taking today what tomorrow never brings
this is the new sound, just like the old sound
just like the noose wound over the new ground
this is the new sound, just like the old sound

'round the time that the doors of the jail cells
open up to greet you like the reaper?

nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
i'm sitting down here in the campfire light
searchin' for the ghost pf tom joad
he pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
the preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
he's waitin' for the time when the "last shall be first, and the first shall be last"
in a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
with a one way ticket to the promised ;and
with a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
bathin' in the cities' aqueducts
and the highway is alive tonight
nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
i'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
with the ghost of old tom joad
now tom said, "ma
whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
wherever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
look for me, ma', i'll be there
wherever somebody's strugglin' for a place to stand
for a decent job or a helpin' hand
wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
look in their eyes, ma, you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
you'll see me
and the highway is alive tonight
nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
i'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
with the ghost of tom joad

yo, i was a fiend before i became a teen
i melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
shot grabbed the mic and try to say, "yes y'all!"
they tried to take it, and say that i'm too small
cool, 'cause i don't get upset
i kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then i jet
back to the lab, without a mic to grab
so then i add all the rhymes i had
one after the another one, then i make another one
to diss the opposite then ask if the brother's done
i get a craving like i fiend for nicotine
but i don't need a cigarette, know what i mean?
i'm raging, ripping up the stage and
don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
thought of, cause it's sort of an addiction
magnetized by the mixing

you can't solve it, you silly rabbit
the prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
i fiend for a microphone like heroin
soon as the bass kicks, i need a fix
gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
and i'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
unawareness? beware, it's the re-animator
a menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
an assasinator, if the people ain't stepping
you see a part of me that you never seen
when i'm fiendin' for a microphone
'cause i take it to the maximum, i can't relax see, i'm
hype as a hypochrondriac 'cause the rap be one
hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
more than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
more than cracked up, you should have backed up
for those who act up need to be more than smacked up

no, i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more
well, i wake up in the morning, fold my hands, and pray for rain

i ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more
nah, i ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more

i ain't gonna work on, nah
i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more
the hills find peace, locked armed guard posts
safe from the screams of the children born as ghosts
gates, guns and alarms shape the calm of the dawn
peering down into the basin where death lives on
when young run foaming at the mouth with hate
when burning batons beat the freezing who shake
under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
of walls deny the terror faced
by the children born as ghosts
born as ghosts
(a warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
born as ghosts
(a warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
born as ghosts
(a warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
born as ghosts
(we are the children born as ghosts, born as ghosts)
one book and forty ghosts stuffed in a room
ah, the school as a tomb
where home is a wasteland, taste the razor wire
and thought is locked in the womb
the tales that tear at the myth of the dream
(myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
a suffering that shocks the lives off the screen
(myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
born as ghosts
(a warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
born as ghosts

greed!
causing innocent blood to flow
entire culture, lost in the overthrow
they came to seize and take whatever they please
then all they gave back was death and disease
my people were left with no choice but to decide
to conform to a system, responsible for genocide
responsible for genocide
responsible for genocide
aids is killing the entire african nation
and a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
but these governments, they don't mind their procrastination
they say, "we'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation."
my people's culture was strong, it was pure
and if not for that white greed, it would've endured
my people were left with no choice but to decide
to conform to a system
their minds enslaved, their souls encaged
i feel the rage, it's brutality can never be undone
but the sun is not yet set
the bass and drums and microphones a threat
that's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside
and see that they're responsible for genocide
responsible for genocide
responsible for genocide
ya cram ya culture down my throat
say i'm inferior when i find it i choke
you fill my mind with a false sense of history
and then you wonder why i have no identity?
well, i'll strike a match and it'll catch and
spread the insight we need
a tiny fire, burning bright
shedding light on the darkness of greed
a yes yes y'all
and ya don't stop
shedding light on the darkness of greed
a yes yes y'all
and ya don't stop
shedding light on the darkness of greed
