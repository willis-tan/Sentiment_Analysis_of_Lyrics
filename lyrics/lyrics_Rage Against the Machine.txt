Come with it now

The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power dons, that five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger’s cold, empty your purse

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Although ya try to discredit, ya still never edit
The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double "I'm Mad", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (What!) the judges (What!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

Yeah
Yeah, back in this

With poetry my mind I flex
"Flip" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up?
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the "Stutter Step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head!?
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard

"Black Nationalism... 
 may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism"
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them"

Think ya know it's all of that, huh
Ayo, so check this out, yeah

Know your enemy
Come on

Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly

Know your enemy
Know your enemy
Yeah
Ayo, get with this, ugh

Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The "land of the free"?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge, and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in

I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
Sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of you
Time has come to pay

Know your enemy


Come on
Yes, I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Compromise, conformity
Assimilation, submission
Ignorance, hypocrisy
Brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams

Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!

Blockin' the beltway, move on DC
Way past the days of bombin' MCs

All you pen devils know the trial was vile
Army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out the box, it's my radio dial

The cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire
So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed
Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria

The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire

Hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey

For it's the end of history
It's caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take

This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue, when ya blood was red
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head, blasted through ya head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen, you was mesmerized
Cellular phones, soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn ya to stone before ya realize
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds!

Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?" Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"
Run it

Checka, checka, check it out

Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time

And mothafuckas lost their minds!
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again, jack, and then rewind the tape
And then play it again, and again, and again
Until ya mind is locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya
They say jump and ya say "how high?"
Ya braindead, ya got a fuckin' bullet in ya head

Just victims of the in-house drive-by

Crank the music up
Bring that shit in, uh
Yeah, the movement's in motion with massive militant poetry
Now check this out, uh

In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back

The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system that cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back

Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it, break it, break it down
Aw shit


And like this
Uh!
Come on
Yeah
Bring it back the other way
Uh

The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
Uh!

Yeah
Take it back, y'all
Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back, y'all
C'mon!
Take it back, y'all
Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back, y'all
Come on

The movie ran through me
The glamour subdue me
The tabloid untied me
I'm empty. please fill me
Mister Anchor, assure me
That Baghdad is burning
Your voice, it is so soothing
That cunning mantra of killing
I need you, my witness
To dress this up so bloodless
To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you
Yes, the car is our wheelchair
My witness, your coughing
Oily silence mocks the legless ones
Who travel now in coffins

While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door

Now testify
Now testify
It's right outside your door, now testify
Yes, testify
It's right outside your door

With precision you feed me
My witness, I'm hungry
Your temple, it calms me, so I can carry on
My slaving, sweating the skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire, I'm choking on the smoke that fills my home
The wrecking ball is rushing
Witness your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs

While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door

Now testify
Yeah, testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify
Now testify
And it's right outside your door

Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set


Who controls the past now, controls the future
Who controls the present now, controls the past

Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

Bangin' this bolo tight, on this solo flight, can't fight alone
Funk the track, my verbs sly like the Family Stone
Them pen devils set the stage for the war at home
Locked without a wage, you're standing in the drop zone
The clockers born, starin' at an empty plate
Mama's torn hands cover her sunken face
We hungry but them belly full
The structure is set, ya never change it with a ballot pull
In the ruins there's a network for the toxic rock
Schoolyard to precinct, suburb to project block
Bosses rode south for new flesh and a factory floor
The remains left chained to the powder war

Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yes, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

Yeah
Bear witness to the sickest shot while suckers get romantic
They ain't gonna send us campin' like they did my man Fred Hampton
Still we lampin', still clockin' dirt for our sweat
A ballot's dead, so a bullet's what I get
A thousand years they had the tools, we should be takin' 'em
Fuck the G-ride, I want the machines that are makin' 'em
Our target straight with a room full of armed pawns
To off the Kings on the west side at dawn

Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

(One god, one market, one truth, one consumer)
Just a quiet, peaceful dance

Ayy, yo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Ayy, yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
It goes a one, two, three
Yeah, and it's just another bombtrack

And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

It goes a one, two, three, another funky, radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

Yeah, people come up
Yeah, we better turn the bass up on this one

Check it, since fifteen hundred and sixteen, Mayans attacked and overseen
Now crawl amidst the ruins of this empty dream
With their borders and boots on top of us
Pullin' knobs on the floor of their toxic metropolis
But how you gonna get what you need to get?
The gut eaters, blood drenched get offensive like Tet
The fifth sun sets get back reclaim
The spirit of Cuauhtémoc, alive and untamed
Now face the funk now blastin' out your speaker
On the one, Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you got a gun
Yeah, this is for the people of the sun

It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again

Yeah, never forget that the whip snapped ya back
Your spine cracked for tobacc-oh, I'm the Marlboro Man, uh
Our past blastin' on through the verses
Brigades of taxi cabs rollin' Broadway like hearses
Troops strippin' zoots, shots of red mist
Sailors' blood on the deck, come sister, resist
From the era of terror, check this photo lens
Now the City of Angels does the ethnic cleanse, uh
Heads bobbin' to the funk out your speaker
On the one, Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you found a gun
You're history
This is for the people of the sun

It's comin' back around again

All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion drawn up by the thoughts I think

Yeah
Come on
The militant poet in once again, check it

It's set up like a deck of cards
They're sendin' us to early graves for all the diamonds
They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades
With poetry, I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away, get in front of it
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three brothers gone, come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?

(Anger is a gift)
Come on
Uh


Drop that
Uh
Come on
Yeah
Uh

Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin' Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three million gone, come on
'Cause you know they're counting backwards to zero
Environment, the environment exceeding
On the level of our unconsciousness
For example, what does the billboard say?
"Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement"

(Anger is a gift)

Yeah

I be walkin' God like a dog, my narrative, fearless
My word war returns to burn like Baldwin home from Paris
Like Steel from a furnace, I was born landless
This is the native son, born of Zapata's guns
Stroll through the shanties and the cities' remains
Same bodies buried hungry but with different last names
These vultures rob everything, leave nothing but chains
Pick a point on the globe, yes, the picture's the same
There's a bank, there's a church, a myth and a hearse
A mall and a loan, a child dead at birth
There's a widow pig parrot, a rebel to tame
A white-hooded judge, a syringe and a vein
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

What you say, what you say, what you say, what?

This ain't subliminal, feel the critical mass approach horizon
The pulse of the condemned, sound off America's demise
The anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, yes, I spit fire
Hope lies in the smoldering rubble of empires
Yes, back through the shanties and the cities' remains
Same bodies buried hungry (Uh-huh), but with different last names (Uh-huh)
Them vultures robbin' everyone, leave nothing but chains
Pick a point here at home, yes, the picture's the same
There's a field full of slaves, some corn and some debt
There's a ditch full of bodies, the check for the rent
There's a tap, the phone, the silence of stone
The numb black screen that be feelin' like home
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?

There's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
There's a right to obey and there's a right to kill
There's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
'Cause there's a right to obey and there's the right to kill

Up jump the boogie, then bang, let 'em hang
While the paranoid try to stuff the void
Let's capture this AM mayhem
Undressed and blessed by the Lord
The power pendulum swings by the umbilical cord
Shock around the clock, from noon 'til noon
Men grabbin' they mics and stuff 'em into the womb
Terror's the product ya push
Well, I'm a truth addict, aw shit, I got a headrush
Sheep tremble and here come the votes
Thrown from the throat, cages and scapegoats
Undressed and blessed by the Lord
The same devil that ran around Managua wit' a sword
Check out the new style that Ollie found
A tune with a bullet to shut down the devil sound

Huh!
Check it
Uh!

Silence, something about silence makes me sick
'Cause silence can be violent sorta like a slit wrist
If the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
But if ya bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
Some speak the sounds but speak in silent voices
Like radio is silent though it fills the air with noises
Its transmissions bring submission as ya mold to the unreal
And mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
Yeah

And mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
With a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)

It's time to flow like the fluid in ya veins
If ya will it, I will spill it and ya out
Just as quick as ya came
Not a silent one, but a defiant one
Never a normal one 'cause I'm the bastard son
With the visions of the move, vocals not to soothe
But to ignite and put in flight my sense of militance
Groovin', playin' that game called survival
The status, the elite, the enemy, the rival
The silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'
Give you a glimpse of the reality I'm grippin'
Steppin' into the jam and I'm slammin' like Shaquille
Mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
Yeah

And mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
With a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)
Aw shit

(And I won't stop, 'cause I know the power of the question!)

And if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
But if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
Yeah
Come on

A .44 full of bullets
Face full of pale
Eyes full of empty
A stare full of nails
The roulette ball
Rolls alone on the wheel
A mind full of fire
And a fistful of steel
And if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
But if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'

Yeah
With a fistful of steel, uh

The main attraction, distraction
Got ya number than number than numb
Empty ya pockets, son, they got you thinkin' that
What ya need is what they selling
Make you think that buying is rebelling
From the theaters to malls on every shore
The thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere, there be no shelter here
Spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
Memories erased, burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a VCR
Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)

Hospitals not profit full
The market bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View the world from American eyes
The poor adore, keep fiendin' for more
The thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste
Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon
And Rambo too, he's got a dope pair of Nikes on
And Godzilla, pure mothafuckin' filler
To keep ya eyes off the real killer
Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)

Bury the past, rob us blind

A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name

Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Death is on my side
Suicide

A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name

Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Caught between my culture and the system
Genocide
Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
If ignorance is bliss
Then knock the smile off my face
Yeah

Rebel, rebel and yell
'Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell, yes, the structure's a cell
Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait?
Come on, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state, get a check up
This is a stick up
Our freedom, or your life
Lord, I wish I could be peaceful
But there can be no sequel
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion
Yeah, what about that, sucka?

Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hardlines
That fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought, and lessons taught
Yes, I'll display the fitness, and flip like a gymnast
Raise my fist and resist!
Asleep though we stand in the midst of the war
Gotta get mine, gotta get more
Keepin' the mic warm against the norm
'Cause what does it offer me?
I think often it's nothin' but a coffin
Gotta get wreck 'til our necks never swing on a rope
From here to the cape of no hope
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

Shackle their minds when they're bent on the cross

My fears hunt me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my

Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man

Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him
An empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within
His thoughts like a hundred moths
Trapped in a lampshade
Somewhere within
Their wings banging and burning
On through endless night
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving
Praying for someone to turn off the light

Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man

My fear is hunting me down
Capturing my memories

Got no card, so I got not soul
Life is prison, no parole, no control
The jura got my number on a wire tap
'Cause I jack for Similac, fuck a Cadillac
Survive, one motive, no hope
'Cause every sidewalk I walk is like a tightrope
Yes, I know my deadline, sire, when my life expires
I'm sendin' paper south under the barbed wire
The mother of my child will lose her mind at my grave
It's my life for their life, so call it a free trade
"Por vida" and our name up on the stall
I took a death trip when I tried to cross the white wall

Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Born without a face
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh
Yeah, born without a face
Without a face

Yeah, I tried to look back to my past long lost
A blood donor to the land owner holocaust
Pop's heart stopped, in came the air drop
Flooded the trench, he couldn't shake the toxic shock
Maize was all we needed to sustain
Now her golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down wit' DDT, yeah, you know me
I'm raped for the grapes, profit for the bourgeoisie
War tape boomin', path is Luminoso
I'm headed north like my name was Kid Cisco
To survive, one motive, no hope, uh
It's hard to breathe with Wilson's hand around my throat, uh
Strangled and mangled, another SS curtain call
When I tried to cross the white walls
When I tried to cross the white walls

Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
One motive, no hope, uh

No matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now
We're the renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet Earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came (Came)
And times continued to change (Change)
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades!

We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk

From a different solar system
Many, many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission, to help the others listen
And groove from land to land, singin' electronic chants like
Zulu Nation

Revelations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations

Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me

Poppin', sockin', rockin', puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin' and sockin' and rockin' and puttin' a side of hip-hop
'Cause we're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of HIP-HOP!!

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

We're teachers of the funk and not of empty popping
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble, the horns, and our vocals
'Cause every time I pop into the beat, we get fresh

Come on

Come on

There was a time when our music
Was something called "The Bay Street" beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade in those days
To take a man to the dance floor

Say jam sucka (Jam sucka)
Say jam sucka (Jam sucka)

Rippin' it up for an even amount in each cup
To my brothers' burning bare feet on black top
Whose curled 'neath the shadows from the gaze of the cops
Whose huntin' for 9 to 5's through factory locks
Is now hunted on this modern day auction block

The sun ablaze as Maria's foot touches the surface of sand
On northern land, as human contraband
Some rico from Jalisco passed her name to the Boss
She stuffed into a truckbed, she clutches her cross
Here comes the exhaust and it rips through her lungs
She's off fast to the pasture, like cattle she'll cross
Degree 106, sweat and vomit are thrown
And she prays and suffocates upon the memories of home
Of Yanqui guns for blood, debts on the loans
Of smoldering fields, rape, rubble and bones
Of graves hidden, trapped up in visions of war
Of nothing, no one, nobody, no more

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates
Through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
And like the sun disappears only to reappear
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here

To tear away at the mask

And now she got a quota, the needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across the new line of Mason Dixon
Rippin' through denim, the point an inch from her vein
The foreman approach, his steps now pound in her brain
His presence, it terrifies and eclipses her days
No minutes to rest, no moments to pray
And with a whisper he whips her, her soul chained to his will
"My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"
Her arms jerk, the sisters gather 'round her and scream
As if in a dream, eyes on the crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to the floor
I am nothing, no one, nobody, no more

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates
Through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates
And like the sun disappears only to reappear (Maria)
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here

To tear away at the mask
Away at the mask
To tear away at the mask

No minutes to rest
No moment to pray
No minutes to rest
No moment to pray
No minutes to rest
It eclipses her day
Just a moment to pray

To tear away at the mask
Away at the mask
To tear away at the mask
To tear away at the mask

His spit is worth more than her work

The sisters are in so check the front line
Seems I spent the '80s in the Haiti state of mind
Cast me into classes for electroshock
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum's a cell block
I'm swimming in half truths and it makes me wanna spit
Instructor come separate the healthy from the sick
Ya weigh me on a scale, smelling burnt skin
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screaming from within
'Cause I'm cell locked in the doctrines of the right
Enslaved by dogma, talk about my birthrights
Yet at every turn I'm running into Hell's gates
So I grip the cannon like Fanon and pass the shells to my classmates
Aw, power to the people
'Cause the boss's right to live is mine to die
So I'm going out heavy sorta like Mount Tai
With the five centuries of penitentiary so let the guilty hang
In the year of the boomerang

I got no property but yo, I'm a piece of it
So let the guilty hang
I got no property but yo, I'm a piece of it

I got no property but yo, I'm a piece of it
So let the guilty hang
I got no property but yo, I'm a piece of it
In the year of the boomerang

Yeah
Now it's upon you
Now it's upon you

The sistas are in so check the front line
Seems I spent the '80s in the Haiti state of mind
Cast me into classes for electro shock
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum's a cell block
I'm swimmin' in half truths and it makes me wanna spit
Instructor come separate the healthy from the sick
Ya weigh me on a scale, smellin' burnt skin
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screamin' from within
'Cause I'm cell locked in tha doctrines of the right
Enslaved by dogma, talk about my birthrights
Yet at every turn I'm runnin' into Hell's gates
So I grip the cannon like Fanon and pass the shells to my classmates
Aw, power to the people
'Cause the bosses right to live is mine to die
So I'm goin' out heavy sorta like Mount Tai
With the five centuries of penitentiary so let the guilty hang
In the year of the boomerang

I got no property but yo, I’m a piece of it
So let tha guilty hang
I got no property but yo, I’m a piece of it
In the year of the Boomerang
I got no property but yo, I’m a piece of it
So let tha guilty hang

Mic check and one, two, one, two
Mic check and one, two
Mic check and one, two

Lick off the shot, my stories shock ya like Ellison
Main line adrenaline, Gaza to Tienanmen
From the basement I'm dwellin' in
I cock back the sling to stone a settler
Breaks him off clean, call me the upsetter
Here comes the hands on the leashes, the cross
The capital, the pale families, the fear, and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
The master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo

Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm
Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm

This hits like fists. bomb with the left and don't miss
With the sickest stilo, I spark fear like pigs in the park
Head crack, I hijack the papers
The vapors caught fire up in your mind, come back, rewind one time
Here comes the hands on the leashes, the cross
The capital, the pale families, the fear, and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
The master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo

Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm
Roll right, roll call

We gotta take 'em to the seventh level
We gotta take 'em to the seventh level
For their lives and my lives were never settled
Come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on
Come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on

Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level

Satellites and pair of mirrors and
And a man without a home
With a horse and a rider
And a clever, cunning killer
Silent in error and vocal in spotlights
Lying always, sucking on a bottle of
That sweet indulgent fluid
Oh greed, oh yes, oh greed, oh yes

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Twenty-six years in this stage)
(You're twenty-six years in this stage)
Your friendship is a fog
That disappears when the wind redirects
You
Yes, you

Father's expectations
Soul soaked in spit and urine
And you gotta make it where?
To a sanctuary that's a fragile American hell
An empty dream
A selfish, horrific vision
Passed on like the deadliest of viruses
Crushing you and your naive profession

Have no illusions, boy
Vomit all ideals and serve
Sleep and wake and serve and
Don't just think, just wake and serve and

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

A mass of hands press on the market window
Ghosts of progress dressed in slow death
Feeding on hunger and glaring through the promise
Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle
A mass of nameless at the oasis
That hides the graves beneath the master's hill
Buried for drinking the river's water while
Shackled to the the line at the empty well

This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over new ground

Listen to the fascist sing
"Take hope here, war is elsewhere
You were chosen, this is God's land
Soon we'll be free of blot and mixture
Seeds planted by our forefathers' hand"

A mass of promises begin to rupture
Like the pockets of the new world kings
Like swollen stomachs In Appalachia
Like the priest that fucked you as he whispered holy things
A mass of tears have transformed the stones now
Sharpened on suffering and woven into the slings
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
Taking today what tomorrow never brings

This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over new ground

This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
Ain't the new sound just like the old sound?
Look at the noose now, over the, over the, over the burning ground
Ain't it funny how the factory's doors close?
'Round the time that the school doors close?
'Round the time that the doors of the jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper?
Ain't it funny how the factory's doors close?
'Round the time that the school doors close?
'Round the time that a hundred thousand jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper?
Oasis
This is no oasis

This is the new sound, just like that old sound
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over new ground

The vocal tone has got 'em sweating their own apocalypse
Yes, rebel of the grains stand masterless
The masked ones cap one, NAFTA coming with the new disaster
And yes, we in with the wind and the Plan de Ayala kin
Coming back around again
The slave driver saliva, one night, power turns
Them devils mouths dry, now Mexico burns
So here they come, one by one, them killers of the new frontier
Occupy, causing fear, come on

With the wind below
We in with the wind below

Yo, they talk it while slicing our veins, yo, so mark it
From the FINCAS overseers to them vultures playing markets
She ain't got nothing but weapon and shawl
She is Chol, Tzotzil, Tojolobal, Tzeltal
The tools are her tools, Ejidos and ovaries
She was strangled, now through a barrel she breathes

She is the wind below

Come on, check it
Through steel walls, your voice blastin' on
True rebel, my brother, Mumia, I reflect upon
You the spark, that set the prairie fires on
Make the masses a mastodon path to trample the fascists on
At fifteen exposed Philly's finest killing machine
Boots and mad guns, they pacify ya young
Cause and effect, smell the smoke in the breeze
My panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless

Well, the powerful got nervous 'cause he refused to be they servant
'Cause he spit truth that burned like black churches
Prose and verses, a million poor in hearses
Watch the decision of Dred Scott as it reverses
Long as the rope is tight around Mumia's neck
Let there be no rich white life we bound to respect
Cause and effect, can't ya smell the smoke in the breeze?
My panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless

And Orwell's hell, a terror era coming through

Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of the fucked up styles that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
'Cause we're like outlaws stridding
Suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush
When they see me driving by
Hanging out my window
And my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kinda loco
I'm just another local kid
From the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

Here is something you can't understand

I've been doin' all the dumb shit, yo, because nothin' is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around, I got ya humming
Hummin', comin' at ya
Then you know I had to gat ya
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction (Uh)
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, "Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed out
How do you like my chrome?" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way
Ha ha ha ha ha! Young punk had to pay
So I just killed the man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite you with these site
So if you ain't down
Bullshit

Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would call the one time and play the role model?
No, I think you'll play like a thug
Next, hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming, coming at ya!
Yeah, you know I'm gonna to gat ya
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, yo, I gotta say, "Fuck it"

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Every official that comes in, cripples us, leaves us maimed
Silent and tamed
And with our flesh and bones, he builds his homes
Southern fist, rise through the jungle mist
Clenched to smash power so cancerous
A black flag and a red star
A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles
Yes, for Raza livin' in La La
Like Gaza on to the dawn of Intifada
Reach for the lessons the masked pass on
And seize the metropolis, it's you it's built on

Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
And everything changed on a new year's day
Come on

War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath

War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land

Their existence is a crime
Their seat, their robe, their tie
Their land deeds, their hired guns
They're the crime
Shots heard underground 'round the rapture
The world's eye captured at last in a Mexican pasture
The masked screaming land or death
Within a breath, a war from the depth of time
Who shot four puppet governors in a line
Who shook all the world bankers who think they can rhyme
Shot the landlords who knew it was mine
Yes, it's a war from the depth of time

Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Come on
Ugh, hear the masked scream

War within a breath

Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn
The spirit of Jackson now screams through the ruins
Through factory chains and the ghost of the Union
The forgotten remains disappear to their new homes
The knife, the thrust, the life burns to the raw bone
The blood on the floor of the tear is still dryin'
Cover the spread sheets, the Dow Jones skyin'
The cell block live stock, the bodies they buyin'
Old south order, new northern horizon!

Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be

Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD

Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn
Yo, yo, check the high tech terror of the new order athletes
Peering into the eyes of the child already on trial
These armies rippin' families apart, get 'em on file
Convictions fit the stock profile all the while
Films of dogs, cuttin' through homes
Ripping skin from bones, yes, the new millennium homes
Privatizing through private eyes, an era rising
Of the old south order, new northern horizon

Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be

Man walks along the railroad track
He's goin' some place, there's no turnin' back
The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up, over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner
Welcome to the New World Order
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest
No job, no hope, no peace, no rest, no rest

And the highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the ghost pf Tom Joad

He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the "last shall be first, and the first shall be last"
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised ;and
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts

And the highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad

Now Tom said, "Ma
Whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
Wherever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me, ma', I'll be there
Wherever somebody's strugglin' for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes, ma, you'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me
You'll see me

And the highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of Tom Joad

Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin' it
Full life, living it, never giving it back
Too late for slipping, so slack up
On my lap, it's on your lips, so track shot
A steel dick, more clip for pump but
All I'm saying there ain't no question who the man is
In my Civic or in this showbiz

Never understood it, but remember I showed you
That in these times, you gotta look over your shoulder, strap
Well, that ain't nothin' but the intent of gettin' high
And a cop giving you shit for just passing you by
If you're ever in trouble or on the double, best to call your pals
If you ain't got none now, sucka, I got a million
Styles around me
Are we getting along? We family, we better be
We got your back, we got your back, kid
Just don't be pointing one of them guns, aight man

Yo, I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, "Yes y'all!"
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab, without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one, then I make another one
To diss the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, cause it's sort of an addiction
Magnetized by the mixing

But back to the problem, I got a habit
You can't solve it, you silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness? Beware, it's the re-animator
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone
'Cause I take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hypochrondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up

No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm no more
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands, and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas that are drivin' me insane
It's a shame, the way she makes me
Scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on, nah
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Nah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel, and he hands you a dime
And he asks you with a grin, if you're havin' a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for, nah
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks
The National Guard .stands around his door
I ain't gonna work for, nah
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law
And everybody says she's the brains behind ma
She's sixty-eight but she says she's twenty-four
I ain't gonna work for, nah
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm no more
Well, I try my best to be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They sing while they slave, and I just get bored
I ain't gonna work on, nah
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm no more

The hills find peace, locked armed guard posts
Safe from the screams of the children born as ghosts
Gates, guns and alarms shape the calm of the dawn
Peering down into the basin where death lives on
When young run foaming at the mouth with hate
When burning batons beat the freezing who shake
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
Of walls deny the terror faced
By the children born as ghosts

Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(We are the children born as ghosts, born as ghosts)

One book and forty ghosts stuffed in a room
Ah, the school as a tomb
Where home is a wasteland, taste the razor wire
And thought is locked in the womb
The tales that tear at the myth of the dream
(Myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
A suffering that shocks the lives off the screen
(Myth of the dream, myth of the dream)

Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)

Coolin' on the scene like a horse in a stable
A brother got ill, and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
I punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
Yo Z, you was packin? You know I was strapped
Posse kept rollin', it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggas
What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train
That can head up your mission, suckers who be dissin'
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Givin' best wishes to the best MC
And when the spot is blown and yo, you know it's me
Because I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
Because I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
Because I'm housin'

Because I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

Coolin' at a party, no better yet disco
Head feelin' mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move
To crush and fry a sucker MC like Crisco
Gimme the cue, check, one, two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
You treatin' me the Z to the D, like a stepchild
Let me tell you homeboy, you're livin' foul
MC's, you know who you are
On the bandwagon, why Z? 'Cause you a star
This is the year when the jokers are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin'
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
Because I'm housin'
Come on

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin'

Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('Cause I'm housin')
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('Cause I'm housin')
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('Cause I'm housin')
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('Cause I'm housin')
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'

Greed!
Causing innocent blood to flow
Entire culture, lost in the overthrow
They came to seize and take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system, responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
AIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
But these governments, they don't mind their procrastination
They say, "We'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation."
My people's culture was strong, it was pure
And if not for that white greed, it would've endured
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system
Their minds enslaved, their souls encaged
I feel the rage, it's brutality can never be undone
But the sun is not yet set
The bass and drums and microphones a threat
That's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside
And see that they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Ya cram ya culture down my throat
Say I'm inferior when I find it I choke
You fill my mind with a false sense of history
And then you wonder why I have no identity?
Well, I'll strike a match and it'll catch and
Spread the insight we need
A tiny fire, burning bright
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
Yeah

It's a Beautiful world we live in
A sweet romantic place
Beautiful people everywhere
The way they show they care
Makes me want to say
"It's a beautiful world
Oh, what a beautiful world
For you"
It's a wonderful time to be here
It's nice to be alive
Wonderful people everywhere
The way they comb their hair
Makes me want to say
"It's a wonderful place
Oh, what a wonderful place
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
Not me"

You tell me you like the taste
You just need an excuse
You tell me it calms your nerves
You just think it looks cool
You tell me you want to be different
You just change for the same
You tell me it's only natural
You just need the proof
Did you fucking get it?

It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes

You tell me that nothing matters
You're just fucking scared
You tell me that I'm better
You just hate yourself
You tell me that you like her
You just wish you did
You tell me that I make no difference
Well, at least I'm fucking trying
What the fuck have you done?

It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me

We're gonna kick 'em out
Well, I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could get crazy now, baby
We all got in tune
When the dressing room got hazy
I know how you want it
When you're hot and tight
The girl can't stand it
When you do it right
When you're up on the stand
Let me kick out the jams
Kick out the jams, we're gonna kick 'em out
And I'm starin' to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet
What a feeling now, baby
The sound that abound and resounds and rebounds straight off of the ceilin'
You gotta have it, baby
You can't do without
You get that feelin', gotta kick 'em out
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jams
Kick out the jams, we gotta kick 'em out
Alright, alright, alright, all
Gotta give it up
You know you can't get enough, Miss McKenzie
'Cause it gets in your brain
And it drives you insane a loopy frenzy
The wigglin' guitar and a crash on the drums
We wanna keep on rockin' 'til the mornin' comes
Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams
Yeah, kick out the jams
I done kicked 'em out

In the industry, you see, they keep a yellow tape
Got the microphone because we want to be free
Never oppress, nor to relay your stress
May lack ability, but now you're put to the test (Go!)
I run a set in the cool atmosphere
Don't worry about my dumb kicks or the car that I steer
That material pressure is just a digressor
Be livin' my life, for they have not yet bothered with pressure, uh

Drop it!
Ease up!
Bringin' in the new lifestyle in 1991 now
With the raggamuffin style we're bringin' it deep, yo
Now bring it down
Aw, shit
Listen to what I'm sayin'
Materialism I'm slayin'
Chasin' a prediction, know what I mean
It's the system your obeyin'
Throwin' it like a catcher
You say what you think, you dancer
Runnin' the free nation
Money's not free, if you thinkin' you want the answer
GO!
I run a set in the cool atmosphere
Don't worry about my dumb kicks or the car that I steer
That material pressure is just a digressor
Be livin' my life, for they have not yet bothered with pressure, uh

In the new sound!
(You know!)
Ease up!

'Cause in this sleepy L.A. town

Floatin' around on a real low mind
See a pretty thing in a wall

Uh
Yeah, deep in the night I'm lost in love

Yeah, it's just another bombtrack
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fade this
But, I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beat-downs
Cold run a train on punk ho's, that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge, and delete
Those who compete, at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall, and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views, that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
The landlords and power whores, on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite, and then watch 'em burn

With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
The landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and I watch 'em burn

Watch 'em burn

Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
Yeah now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if you interfere

With the thoughts from a militant militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
The landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite, then I watch 'em burn

Watch 'em burn
Yeah watch them burn

Watch 'em burn

Yeah I tried to look back to my past long lost
A blood donor to the land owner Holocaust
Pop's heart stopped, in came the air drop
Flooded the trench, couldn't shake the toxic shock
Maize, was all we needed to sustain
Now her golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down wit DDT - yeah, you know me
I'm raped for the grapes, and the profit for the bourgeoisie
War tape boomin, path is Luminoso
I'm headed north like my name was Kid Cisco
To survive, just a prophet lost and learned
I got to break 'em off and watch 'em burn

Watch 'em burn
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Earth shares what Earth receives
And now only blood brings life
A tiller bring life, producer bring life
Protector bring life, soiled hands bring life
The tree of democracy shall be watered by the blood of revolution
So go plant a seed, go plant a seed for harvest
Go plant a seed for harvest producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer
And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall
It all shall fall
I first met you and the ideas you uphold while incarserated A victim of a social experiment
Eventually addicted to your eight hour injections of hypocracy and arrogance and greed
Forced to sit with coplicity in front of my executioners
As they blugeoned me with their so called superior values and demanded my submission
I bacame an indentured servant in a factory
Where I myself was the product
Whos' useful quality was to protect their palaces
Every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me
So that every thought I express
Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks
And set fire to their homes
And every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me
So that every thought I express
Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks
And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes
And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall

Come with it now!
Come with it now!

The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power dons, that five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger’s cold, empty your purse

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery, now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally round the family, pockets full of shells

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Bulls on parade! Uh...
