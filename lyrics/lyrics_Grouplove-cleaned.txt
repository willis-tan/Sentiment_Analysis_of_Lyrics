(on the kitchen floor)
oh, mommy's late from work
she's stopping at the store
whoa-oh, oh oh
oh, this is how it goes
she was just a schoolgirl
she thought she met a dream
or so it seems, so it seems
i spent some summer nights
wrapped up in her backyard
oh, i was so in love
and then i fell apart
oh, when the room stood still
oh, oh when the room stood still
(make me up, make me up)
or else i could tell you why
(make me up, make me up)
you're the reason i'm alive
(this is how you remember me now)
and just out the door is killing me
oh, oh
and it was all so hazy
running 'round this river town
the time we spent was here
and it can drive me crazy
thinking 'bout that schoolboy
and how he disappeared
oh, when the room stood still
oh, when the room stood still
(make me up, make me up)
oh, i wish i could tell you why
(make me up, make me up, oh)
you're the reason i'm alive
(this is how you remember me now)
and just out the door is killing me
and all my
secrets wrapped around
this golden crown
and buried backwards
behind my house
it's in the ground
and always wondered when
you'll come and dig it out
oh no!
make me up, make me up, oh
make me up, make me up, oh
this is how you remember me
and something's always killin' me

a little bird just told me so
it's time to start over again
so i'll man up and take this boat
far away from these shores
and i'll reach behind an enemy line
and find my curable cure
'cause it's a cruel and beautiful world
and i got my girl
and if it seems like we're falling behind
or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind
i buried a treasure far off near the desert
i'm trying to find my way there
it's been too long since i've been myself
and my eyes can't see anymore
but there's a song inside this heart of mine
and i'd like to sing it to you
'cause there's an earthquake shaking inside my country
now what am i gonna do?
'cause it's a cruel and beautiful world
and i got my girl
and if it seems like we're falling behind
or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind

but the beach boys bring that endless summer to your room
from the dive bar you can make it to that sold-out show
and you want that sacred love, won't you just make it so
but if things stop and lock down
got to bend that ear near to the ground
and every time you get lost, get found
and when you raise up that glass, drink it down
like hand-written mail we're just tales that are soon forgotten
sink your teeth in the flesh of this new horizon
had 'em screaming out "oh, my lord"
being cannonball, bringing all hell to the board
being cannonball
cannonball
got me screaming out "oh, my lord"
i'm a cannonball, bringing all hell to the floor
through the rooftop, through that gridlock, through the alleyways
if the world's your canvas, just pick up that brush and paint
if you're caught between a rock and me and watch you wait
better find another route, don't even fucking hate
i'll follow ya
as if you were my lover
yeah even if the dance is lost
and we're all going under
like hand-written mail we're just tales that are soon forgotten
sink your teeth in the flesh of this new horizon

be a cannonball, bringing all hell to the board
be cannonball
cannonball
got me screaming out "oh, my lord"

dim the lights, dim the lights, dim the lights, low
you can come and join me, sit around the piano
you can light the fire, open up the window
you can make a choice by seeing where the wind blows
you can watch me sleeping and i can watch you dreaming
you can change the channel and i can change the feeling
call my name, call my name, call my name out
you can find the key and i can find the way out
honestly, tell me, tell me what you like
i can sit awake from midnight to daylight
you can watch me sleeping and i can watch you dreaming
you can change the channel and i can change the feeling
chloe, i don't need a reason
well, i'm bound by the sweet condition
chloe, we don't need permission
we can go where we wanna go
say what we wanna say, and
do what we wanna do
dim the lights, dim the lights, dim the lights, low
you can come and join me, sit around the piano
you can light the fire, open up the window
you can make a choice by seeing where the wind blows
you can watch me sleeping and i can watch you dreaming
you can change the channel and i can change the feeling
chloe, i don't need a reason

so you travel around this country
you're looking for your holy ghost
and what you gonna find?
is it somewhere you like to hide?
so you'll run around your ego
you'll run around your gold coast
you know you got the time
because this prison is our own design
so you're thinking of your future
your thinking of some old past
and it's your time to shine
so what you gonna go and leave behind?
and there's no one to be in with
there's nothing left downstairs
and when you feel despair
what's your method to get out of there?
so where you from son? and are you a troubled one?
and if so come under my wing
and what's your story? and is there glory or hate?
cause that is the only way i think
so you run around this earth top
you run around your head mouth
and what you want to find is peace of mind
of which you can't describe
and it's definitely something, it's definitely somewhere
you know the signs are there
call it a fable or just be unfair
so where are you from girl? and will you paint my world?
and if so come under my wing
and what's your story? and is there glory or hate?
cause that's the only way i think
