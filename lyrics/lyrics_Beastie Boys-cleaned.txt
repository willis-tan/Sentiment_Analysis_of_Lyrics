i run the marathons 'til the very last mile
well, if you battle me, i will revile
people always saying my style is wild
you've got gall, you've got guile (guile)

i can't stand it, i know you planned it
i'm-a set it straight, this watergate
i can't stand rockin' when i'm in here
cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
so while you sit back and wonder why
i got this fuckin' thorn in my side
oh my god, it's a mirage
i'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage
so, so, so, so listen up, cause you can't say nothin'
you'll shut me down with a push of your button
but, yo, i'm out and i'm gone
i'll tell you now, i keep it on and on
cause what you see, you might not get
and we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
i'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage
whhhhhyyyyyy
(our backs are now against the wall)
listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
i can't stand it, i know you planned it
i'm-a set it straight, this watergate
but i can't stand rockin' when i'm in this place
because i feel disgrace because you're all in my face
but make no mistakes and switch up my channel
i'm buddy rich when i fly off the handle
what could it be -it's a mirage
you're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage
now here's a little story i've got to tell
about three bad brothers you know so well
it started way back in history
with ad-rock, mca, (and me) mike d
been had a little horsey named paul revere
just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
riding across the land, kicking up sand
sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause i'm in demand
one lonely beastie i be
all by myself without nobody
the sun is beating down on my baseball hat
the air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat
looking for a girl, i ran into a guy
his name was mca, i said howdy, he said hi
he told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
the brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
his voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip
he said, "can i get some?" – i said, "you can't get none!"
had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun
quick on the draw, i thought i'd be dead
he put the gun to my head, and this is what he said
now my name is mca, i've got a license to kill(yeah)
i think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill(yeah)
now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer? (uh huh)
i run this land, you understand? i've made myself clear?
we stepped into the wind, he had a gun, i had a grin
you think this story's over, but it's ready to begin
now i got the gun, you got the brew
you got two choices of what you can do
it's not a tough decision as you can see
i can blow you away or you can ride with me
i said, i'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
the sheriff's after me for what i did to his daughter
i did it like this, i did it like that
i did it with a wiffleball bat
so i'm on the run, the cop got my gun
and right about now it's time to have some fun
the king ad-rock, that is my name
and i know the fly spot where they got the champagne
we rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot
the beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
this dude was staring like he knows who we are
we took the empty spot next to him at the bar
mca said, "yippie yo, you know this kid?"
i said i didn't, but i know he did
the kid said, ("get ready 'cause this ain't funny
my name's mike d and i'm about to get money")
pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky
he yelled ("stick 'em up!") and let two fly
hands went up and people hit the floor
he wasted two kids that ran for the door
("i'm mike d and i get respect
your cash and your jewelry is what i expect")
mca was with it and he's my ace
so i grabbed the piano player and i punched him in the face
piano player's out, the music stopped
his boy had beef and he got dropped
(mike d grabbed the money) mca snatched the gold
i grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold
to mario c—you can't front on that
well just plug me in just like i was eddie harris
you're eating crazy cheese like you would think i'm from paris
you know i get fly, you think i get high
you know that i'm gone and i'm-a tell you all why
so tell me who are you dissing; maybe i'm missing
the reason that you're smiling or wyling, so listen
in my head, i just want to take 'em down
imagination set loose and i'm gonna shake 'em down
let it flow like a mud-slide
when i get on, i like to ride and glide
i've got depth of perception in my text, y'all
i get props at my mention 'cause i vex, y'all
so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
i get so funny with my money that you flaunt
i said, "where'd you get your information from, huh?
you think that you can front when revelation comes?"
(yeah, you can't front on that)
well they call me mike d, the ever-loving man
i'm like spoonie gee (whoo ooh), i'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah)
you scream and you holler about my chevy impala
but the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar
but like a dream i'm flowing without no stopping
sweeter than a cherry pie with reddi whip topping
going from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
well i'll be calling out to people like a casting call
ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
with your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by
believe me, what you see is what you get
and you see me, i'm coming off as you can bet
well i think i'm losing my mind, this time
this time i'm losing my mind; that's right
i said i think i'm losing my mind, this time
this time, i'm losing my mind
yeah, you can't front on that
but little do you know about something that i talk about
i'm tired of driving, it's due time that i walkabout
but in the meantime, i'm wise to the demise
i've got eyes in the back of my head so i realize
well i'm dr. spock, i'm here to rock, y'all
i want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
i said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
i said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce
so i reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
see, i'm the long leaner victor the cleaner
i'm the illest motherfucker from here to gardena
well i'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
you've got the rhyme and reason, but got no cause
but if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease
i've got news for you crews, you'll be sucking like a leech
yeah, you can't front on that
so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
i said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
i said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)

and when i'm on the mic—the suckers run (word!)

i get it, i got it—i know it's good
the rhymes i write—you wish you would
i'm never in training, my voice is not straining
people always biting, and i'm sick of complaining
so i went into the locker room, during classes
went into your locker and i smashed your glasses
you're from secaucus—i'm from manhattan
you're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'
("there it is")
kick it!
father to many—married to none
and in case you're unaware; i carry a gun (word)
stepped into the party—the place was over-packed
saw the kid that dissed my homeboy, shot him in the back
man, i had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
you better keep your mouth shut 'cause i'm fully strapped
i got money in the bank—i can still get high
that's why your girlfriend thinks that i'm so fly
i've got money and juice—twin sisters in my bed
their father had envy so i shot him in the head
if i played guitar, i'd be jimmy page
the girlies i like are underage (shh! check it)
girls with boyfriends are the kinds i like
i'll steal your honey like i stole your bike
my father—he's jealous 'cause i'm making that green (what up?)
i've got a list of girlies' numbers from the places i've been
("there it is")
kick it!
you wanna know why? because i'm—
october 31st, that is my date of birth
i got to the party, you know what i did? the smurf!
taxin' all the females, from coast to coast
and when i get my fill, i'm chilly most
we ragtag girlies back at the hotel
and then we all switch places when i ring the bell
i chill at white castle 'cause it's the best
but i'm fly at fatburger when—when he's—i'm way out west (check it)
check; k-i-n-g a-d—whammy!
all the fine ladies, they're on my jammy
went to the prom—wore the fly, blue rental
got six girlies in my lincoln continental
i met a girl at the party and she started to flirt
i told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt (check it)
spent some bank, got a high powered jumbo
rolled up a wooly—what'd he do?—and i watched columbo
let me clear my throat
kick it over here, baby pop
and let all the fly skimmies feel the beat—
mmm—drop
coolin' on the corner on a hot summer's  day
just me, my posse, and—mca
a lot of beer, a lot of girls, and a lot of cursin'
.22 automatic on my person
got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
my posse's gettin' big—and my posse's gettin' bigger
some voices got treble—some voices got bass
we got the kind of voices that are in your face!
like the bun to the burger—and like the burger to the bun
like the cherry—to the apple—to the peach—to the plum
i'm the king of the ave.—and i'm the king of the block
well, i'm mca—and i'm the king ad-rock
well, i'm mike d—i got all the fly juice

i've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
i gotta straighten my thoughts
i'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
i'll have to step back, i gotta contemplate

i want to offer my love and respect to the end
well, you say i'm twenty-something and i should be slacking
but i'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking

and in the morning it's girls
'cause in the evening it's girls
i like the way that they walk
and it's chill to hear them talk
and i can always make them smile
from white castle to the nile
back in the day
there was this girl around the way
she liked my home-piece mca
he said he would not give her play
i asked him, "please?" – he said, "you may."
her pants were tight and that's ok
if she would dance, i would dj
we took a walk down to the bay
i hope she'll say
"hey, me and you should hit the hay!"
i asked her out, she said "no way!"
i should've probably guessed her gay
so i broke north with no delay
i heard she moved real far away
that was two years ago this may
i seen her just the other day
jockin' mike d. to my dismay
girls – to do the dishes
girls – to clean up my room
girls – to do the laundry
girls – and in the bathroom
girls – that's all i really want is girls
two at a time – i want girls
with new wave hairdos – i want girls
i ought to whip out my – girls, girls, girls, girls, girls!

i'm a motherfuckin' nick at night
with classics rerunning that you know all right
now remain calm, no alarm
'cause my farm ain't fat
so what's up with that?
i've got friends and family that i respect
when i think i'm too good, they put me in check

scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair
launched that shot, and he was caught out there

i loaded up the slingshot, let one fly
he went for his to find he didn't have one
put him in check, correct, with my egg-gun
the egg, a symbol of life

humpty dumpty was a big fat egg
he was playing the wall, then he broke his leg
tossed it out the window, three minutes hot
hit the rastaman, he said, (bloodclot!)
which came first, the chicken or the egg?
i egged the chicken, and then i ate his leg
riding the trains, in between cars
when i pull out the station, you're gonna get yours
drive-by eggings, plaguing la
"yo, you just got my little cousin, ese!"
sometimes hard-boiled, sometimes runny (ray)
comes from a chicken, not a bunny, dummy
people laugh, it's no joke
my name's "yauch" and i'm throwing the yolk
"now they got me in a cell," but i don't care
it was then that i got caught catching people out there
up on the roof, in my car, up all night
i'm going through science like dolemite

date women on tv with the help of chuck woolery
words flowin' out just like the grand canyon
and i'm always out lookin' for a female companion
i threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
i took off her moccasins and put on the bib
wheelin' and dealin', i make a little bit of a stealin'
i'll bring you back to the place and your dress i'm peelin'
your body's on time and your mind is appealin'
starin' at the cracks up there up on the ceilin'

i'm talking to a girl, telling her i'm all-knowing

i'm telling her every lie that you know that i never did
hey ladies, get funky
all the ladies in the house

well, me in the corner with a good-lookin' daughter
i dropped my drawers and said, "welcome back kotter"
we was cuttin' up the rug, she started cuttin' up the carpet
in my apartment, i begged her please stop it
the gift of gab is the gift that i have
and that girl ain't nothin' but a crab
educated… no, stupid… yep
and when i say stupid, i mean stupid fresh
i'm not james at 15 or chachi in charge
i'm adam, and i'm adamant about livin' large
with the white sassoons and the looks that kill
makin' love in the back of my coupe de ville
i met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie
i liked the little cutie, but i kicked her in the booty
cause i don't kinda go for that messin' around
you be listenin' to my records', a number one sound
step, step to the rhythm, step, step to the rhyme

vincent van gogh, go and mail that ear
i call her in the middle of the night when i'm drinkin'
the phone booth on the corner is damp, and it's stinkin'
she said come on over, it was me that she missed
i threw that trash can through her window cause you know i got dissed
your old lady left you, and you went insane
you blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train
well, take my advice at any price
a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man
suckin' down pints 'till i didn't know
woke up in the morning with the won ton ho
cause i announce, i like girls that bounce
with the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
girls with curls, and big long locks
and beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks
walkin' high and mighty like she's number one
she thinks she's the passionate one
hey ladies, get funky

equinox symmetry and the balance is right
smokin' and drinkin' on a tuesday night
it's not how you play the game, it's how you win it
i cheat and steal and sin, and i'm a cynic
for those about to rock, we salute you
the dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to
i once was lost, but now i'm found
the music washes over, and you're one with the sound
well, who shall inherit the earth? the meek shall
and, yo, i think i'm starting to peak now, al
and the man upstairs, well, i hope that he cares
if i had a penny for my thoughts, i'd be a millionaire
we're just three emcees, and we're on the go
shadrach, meshach, abednego!
only 24 hours in a day, only 12 notes, well, a man can play
music for all, but not just one people
and now we're gonna bust with the putney swope sequel
more adidas sneakers than a plumber's got pliers
got more suits than jacoby & meyers
if not for my vices, and my bugged-out desires
my year would be good just like goodyear's tires
cause i'm out picking pockets at the atlantic antic
and nobody wants to hear you because your rhymes are damn frantic
i mix business with pleasure way too much
you know -wine and women and song and such
i don't get blue -i got a mean red streak
you don't pay the band, your friends, yo, that's weak
get even like steven like pulling a rambo
well, shadrach, meshach, abednego!
steal from the rich, and i'm out robbing banks
givin' to the poor, and i always give thanks
because i've got more stories than j.d.'s got salinger
i hold the title, and you are the challenger
i've got money like charles dickens
i've got the girlies in the coupe like the colonel's got the chickens
and i'm always going out dapper like harry s. truman
i'm madder than mad's alfred e. newman
(never gonna let them say that i don't love you)
well, my noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts
and adam yoggin is yauch, and he's rockin' of course
smoke the holy chalice, got my own religion
rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
like jerry lee swaggart or jerry lee falwell
you love mario andretti cause he always drives his car well
vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
and we love the hot butter on what? the popcorn
sippin' on wine and mackin'
rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin'
ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me, homes
(being very proud to be an mc)
and the man upstairs, well, i hope that he cares
if i had a penny for my thoughts, i'd be a millionaire
amps and crossovers under my rear hood
because the bass is bumping from the back of my fleetwood
they tell us what to do? hell, no!
shadrach, meshach, abednego

"well, i think it's 'booty'. booty, booty, that's what it is."
yes, i got more bounce than the fucking bump
and then you want to know why
because i'm motherfuckin' truckin'
i'm in the pocket just like grady tate
got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait
cause i'm the master blaster, drinking up the shasta
my voice sounds sweet cause it has to
so light a match to my ass cause i'm blowin' up
i'd like to thank the people for just showin' up
but now i want y'all to move it
put your point on the floor and just prove it
and i'm smurfin', not rehearsin', gettin' live, y'all
a little puffy, so you know what, i'm doin' right
cause that's the kind of frame of mind i'm in
i got this feelin' that it's back again
so don't touch me, cause i'm electric
and if you touch me, you'll get shocked
you got, you got, you got, you got, you got
you've got the boomin' system, but it's sloshing out doo-doo
you think it's chocolate milk, but it's watered down yoo-hoo
i've been through many times in which i thought i might lose it
the only thing that saved me, has always been music
we've got our own studio, the son of the g
it's no question, life's been good to me
cause life ain't nothing but a good groove
a good mixtape to put ya in the right mood
this one goes out to my man, the groove merchant
coming through with beats for which i've been searching
like two sealed copies, of expansions
i'm like tom vu with yachts and mansions
the logo i sport is the face of the monkey
union made, ben davis-quality, it's no junk, see?
my chrome is shining, just like an icicle
i ride around town on my low-rider bicycle
so many wack emcees, you get the tv bozak
ain't even gonna call out your names, cause you're so wack
and one big oaf, who's faker than plastic
a dictionary definition of the word spastic
you should have never started something that you couldn't finish
cause writin' rhymes to me is like popeye to spinach
i'm bad ass, move ya fat ass, cause you're wack, son
dancing around like you think you're janet jackson
thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on
i'll put the rug out under your ass as i talk on
i'll take you out like a sniper on a roof
like an emcee at the fever in the dj booth
with your headphones strapped, you're rockin' rewind/pause
tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours
but like a pencil to the paper, i got more to come
one after another, you can all get some
so you better take your time and meditate on your rhyme
cause your shit'll be stinkin' when i go for mine
and that's right, y'all, don't get uptight, y'all
you can't say shit because you're biting what i write, y'all
and that's wrong, y'all, over the long haul
you can't cut the mustard when you're fronting it all
(it all, it all, it all…)
yeah, get up
yeah
uh
yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser
back on the mic, it's the anti-depressor
ad-rock--no pressure--yes, we need this
the best is yet to come and, yes, believe this
leggo my eggo while i flex my ego
sip on prosecco, dressed up tuxedo
sipping coffee, playing keno in the casino
want a lucky number, ask mike dino
i burn the competition like a flamethrower
my rhymes, they age like wine as i get older
i'm getting bolder, competition is wanin'
i got the ball and i see the lane and
we got a party on the left, a party on the right
we gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
make some noise if you're with me
you gotta make some noise if you're with me
crazy, crazy, crazy
armed insurrection, popular election
get paid every year like tax collection
hear my perfection, rotary connection
taking mcs down by lethal rap injection
i'm like an ornithologist when i get pissed
you must have drank a fizzy-lifting drink and you got lifted
and sifted, i'm just riffingand when i catch mcs, it's time for wing clipping
i fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
a seagull, i sniff suckers out like a beagle
my ego is off and running and gone
cause i'm about the best and if you fess, well, that's wrong
we got a-we got a party on the left, a party on the right
we gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
make some noise if you're with me
you gotta make some noise if you're with me
crazy, crazy, crazy
the break is crazy
crazy-crazy
pass me the scalpel, i'll make an incision
i'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
put it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf
and you can show it to your friends and say, "that's my old self"
can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
don't bug me now because i'm doing the lambada (bada!)
the forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance
to make romance in my b-boy stance
parlay romancing into financing
opened up a restaurant with ted danson
the roaches check in, but they never check out
i set the record straight, no doubt
we got a-we got a party on the left, a party on the right
we gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
make some noise if you're with me
you gotta make some noise if you're with me
i stay up all night, i go to sleep watching dragnet
never sleep alone because jimmy is the magnet
i'm so rope, they call me mr. roper
when the troubles arise, you know i'm the cool coper
on the mic i score, just like the yankees
get over on miss crabtree like my main man spankee
excuse me young lady, i don't mean to trouble ya
but you're lookin' so fly inside your bmw
i got lucky, i brought home the kitten
before i got busy, i slipped on the mitten
can't get better odds because i'm a sure thing
proud mary keeps on turning and rolling like a ring-ding
jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
doo-wah diddy and bust in with the pre-roll
customs jailed me over an herb seed
don't rat on your boy over some rat weed
i'm outta your back door, i'm into another
your boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother
not perfect grammar, always perfect timing
the mike stands for money and the d is for diamonds
roses are red, the sky is blue
i got my barrel at your neck, so what the fuck you gonna do?
it's just two wheels and me, the wind in my eyes
the engine is the music and my nine's by my side
cause you know y-a-u-c-h
i'm taking all emcees out in the place
takin' life as it comes, no fool am i
i'm goin' off, gettin' paid, and i don't ask why
playin' beats on my box, makin' music for the many
know a lot of def girls that’ll do anything
a lot of parents like to think i'm a villain
i'm just chillin', like bob dylan
yeah, i smoke cheeba, it helps me with my brain
i might be a little dusted but i'm not insane
people come up to me, and they try to talk shit
man, i was making records when you were suckin' your mother's dick
girl, you're walking tall now in your fancy clothes
you got fancy things, they're going up your nose
you're getting fancy gifts from expensive men
you're a dog on a leash, like a pig in a pen
mothership connection, getting girls' affection
if your life needs correction, don't follow my direction
you got your 8 by 10, your agent, your harley
you be driving around hollywood with yo, "sorry, charlie"
cause i'm running things like some mack motherfucker
you slipin', you slackin', cause you're a false fake sucker
you slip, you slack; you clock me, and you lack
while i'm reading "on the road" by my man, jack kerouac
poetry in motion, coconut lotion
had to diss the girl because she got too emotional
are you experienced, little girl?
i want to know what goes on in your little girl world
cause i'm on your mind, it's hard to forget me
i'll take your pride for a ride if you let me
so peace out, y'all, a pcp, song out
full throttle to the bottle and full, full clout
and i'm out
'cause i'm the high plains drifter, and i'm the drifter
the high plains drifter, and i'm the drifter
they can’t catch me, they’re never going to find me
they're never gonna know that i'm the high plains drifter
pulled over to the river, to take a rest
pulled out a pair of pliers, pulled a bullet out of my chest
fear and loathing 'cross the country, listenin' to my 8-track
i reached behind the seat and snatched a kool from the pack
i'm long-distance from my girl, and i'm talking on the cellular
she said that she was sorry and i said, "yeah the hell you were"
check the rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display
check the odometer, and i was on my way
cause i'm the high plains drifter, the best that you can get
a strapped shoplifter, a pirate on cassette
bust a travis bickle when i feel that i'm getting pushed
don't step to me 'cause you could be getting mushed
i'm doing 120 plowing over mailboxes
radar detector to tell me where the cops is
spend another night at the motel 6
it's five dollars extra to get the porno flicks
and then i concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter
i'm a kleptomaniac k-mart shoplifter
cash flow getting low, so i had to pull a job
found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
i left my car outside and the engine still revving
takin' care of business at 7-eleven
and then i went inside to make my withdrawal
i saw what he had had, but i had to take it all
knucklehead deli tried to gyp me off the price
so i clocked him on the turban with a bag of ice
cause i'm mo-lello like yo-lello, cool like lemonade
i made my getaway, and then i thought that i had it made
i feel like steve mcqueen, a former movie star
looked in the rear view mirror, seen the police car
ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
i couldn't help to notice i was caught in a speed trap
dirty mary, crazy larry, on the run from dirty harry
stash the cash in the dash, but my gun i did carry
i'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
i got my alibi straight, and i pulled over to the right
the cop knocked on my window and said, "boy, where's the fire?"
"you got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire"
"outta the car, longhair!" "your goose is cooked"
read me my rights, fingerprinted and booked
making like a dt, driving a grand fury
wherever i hang my hat's my home, and my past is kind of blurry
every dog will have his day, mine will be in front of a jury
high plains drifter, you know that i'm never in a hurry
read me my rights as if i didn't know this
threw me in the tank with a drunk called otis
with his 5 o'clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer
my man turned to me and said, "why are you here?"
i said, "i'm charming, i'm dashing, i'm rental-car bashing
i'm phony-paper passing at nix check cashing"
i went before the judge he sent me to the brooklyn house of d
he said, "you behave, or we'll throw away the key"
houdini'd out the cuffs, kicked the screw in the knee
i took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to otb
i had a good feeling, easy come, easy go
i bet on one horse to win and your mother to show
and sure enough, that nag came in
brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
and then i broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
hot-wired, hot wheeled and, "suzy is a headbanger"
goodness gracious!

i got a girl in the castle and one in the pagoda
you know i got rhymes like abe vigoda
i'm a def manhattan killer a rhyme thriller
a mic in my hand (bust it) and a mouth full of miller
i got a hat, not a visor i drink budweiser
the turntables, up on the drum riser
the needle's in the groove and the vinyl's on the platter
i know that i'm fly; man, there's no need to flatter
i travel around the globe, it's keeping girlies dizzy
my name's mike d. now watch me get busy, y'all
g-g-get busy y'all
g-g-get busy y'all
you're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted
dusted, rusted, mustard, 'sgusted
cheaper than a hot dog with no mustard
mustard, mustard, mustard, mustard
you tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted
busted, busted, busted, busted
because your crew's all soft and i'm disgusted
'sgusted, 'sgusted,  'sgusted
i'm from downtown from the city from of manhattan
i got a lotta girlies and not one's cattin'
my posse's in effect and we're doin' the do
and we got more rhymes than your whole damn crew
caught you poppin' that weak and you must have been dusted
dusted, dusted, dusted, dusted
stuck your head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it
flushed it, flushed it, flushed it, flushed it
word
well, this girl came up to me she says she's new in town
but the crew been said they seen her around
i thought they were right but i didn't want to know
the girlie was def and she wanted to go
i think her name is lucy but they all call loose
i think i thought i seen her on eighth and forty-deuce
the next thing she said was, "my place or yours?
let's kick some bass behind closed doors!"
we got into the cab the cab driver said
he recognized my girlie from the back of her head
he said a little something about tip to base
so i made him stop the cab to get out of the place
shouldn't have looked back, man, i'll always regret it
something's going on and i'll probably never get it
she was crying like a baby stupid dumb
it's just too bad that girl's a bum
(chorus) she's crafty she gets around
she's crafty she's always down
she's crafty she's got a gripe
she's crafty and she's just my type
she's crafty
i spent my last dollar to buy a sabrett
when i seen this girl i could never forget
now, i like nothing better than a pretty girl's smile
and i haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while
the girl came up to me, she said she loved the show
i asked her to come home and she couldn't say no
we got to the crib there's adam and d
we didn't say a word they just stared at me
i said, "i don't know her i just met her tonight."
and adrock started hiding everything in sight
d pulled me over said hide your gold
the girl is crafty like ice is cold
the girl is crafty she knows all the moves
i started playing records she knew all the grooves
he thought she was a thief and d was right
but i just figured she'd spend the night
when i woke up late in the afternoon
she had taken all the things from inside his room
i found myself naked in the middle of the floor
she had taken the bed and the chest of drawers
the mirror, the tv, the new guitar cord
my remote control and my old skateboard
she robbed us blind she took all we owned
and the boys blamed me for bringing her home
she's crafty, she gets around
she's crafty, she's always down
she's crafty, she's got a gripe
she's crafty and she's just my type
she's crafty
uh, yeah
(repeat chorus x2)
"ready? one... you will do this four times with the left
four with the right, then eight times with both
then repeat" ah... clap your hands...

we need body rockin' not perfection
let your backbone flip but don't slip a disc
and let your spine unwind — just take a risk

mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn
puttin' bodies in motion 'cause i got the notion
like roy cormier with the coconut lotion
the sound of the music makin' you insane
you can't explain to people this type of mind frame
like a bottle of châteauneuf-du-pape
i'm fine like wine when i start to rap
we need body-rockin', not perfection
let me get some action from the back section
body movin', body movin'
a1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
body movin', body movin'

i said, ooh my-my and thank you, ma'am
and when i grab the mic, you scream, "ooh, goddamn"
the crème de la crème is who i am
mca, where have you been?
packed like sardines in the tin
so kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'cause when it comes to quarries i'm known to swim
and adrock, light up the place
and if you pull my card, you pull the ace
and if you ask me, turn up the bass
and if you play defender
i could be your hyperspace... so
body movin', body movin'
a1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
body movin', body movin'
we be getting down and you know we're krush groovin'
"you will do eight hops on the left, eight on the right
four left, four right, two left, two right, the one each
left right, left right. start and land on the balls of the feet
left foot... ready? it's one two three four five"
they got a committee to get me off the block
cause i say my rhymes loud and i say 'em nonstop
because being bad news is what we're all about
we went to white castle and we got thrown out
i got my boy mike d. i got the king adrock
i got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
i shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud
so i reached in the miller cooler, grabbed a cool bud
slow riding, gun hidin', on the go
i'm fly like an eagle and i drink old crow
i'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back
my teacher had beef so i gave her a smack
she chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler
went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler
with bottle in hand, at the microphone stand
ay, yo, homeboy what you drinkin', man?

because i'm hard hittin' always bitten cool as hell
i got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell
sittin' around the house gettin' high and watchin' tube
eating colonel's chicken drinkin' heineken brew
i'm a gangster, i'm a prankster i'm the king of the ave
i'm hated, confrontated for the juice that i have
all the fine ladies are making a fuss
but i can't pay attention cause i'm on that dust
i'm rolling down the hill, snowballing, getting bigger
an explosion in the chamber, the hammer from the trigger
i seen him get stabbed, i watched the blood spill out
he had more cuts than my man chuck chillout
24 is my age, and .22 is my gauge
i'm writing rhymes on a page, i'm goin' off in a rage
cause i'm out on a mission, a stolen car mission
had a small problem with the transmission
three on the tree in the middle of the night
i have this steak on my head 'cause i got into a fist fight
life comes in phases, take the good with the bad
you bought the coins on the street (holmes), and you know you got had
because it's all high spirit, you know you got to hear it
don't touch the mic, baby, don't come near it
it's gonna get you, it's gonna get you
it's gonna get you, girl, it's gonna get you
looking down the barrel of a gun
son of a gun, son of a bitch
getting paid, getting rich
ultra violence be running through my head
cold medina, y'all, makin' me see red
rapid fire louie, like rambo got bullets
i'ma die harder, like my kid bruce willis
i love girlies, waxing and milking
coordinating trim is my man, dave scilken
predetermined destiny is who i am
you got your finger on the trigger like the son of sam i am
like clockwork orange, going off on the town
i've got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down
well, i'm mad at my desk, and i'll be writing all curse words
expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words
you're a headless chicken chasin', a sucker freebasin'
you're looking for a fist to put your face in
well, get hip, get hip, don't slip ya knuckle heads
racism is schism, on a serious tip
some static started in the pool hall
hit a motherfucker's face with the cue ball
and i met this girl, she tried to gank me
so i smacked her in the booty with a plank, b
'cause me and my crew are out breaking windows
the bingo, the lotto, you know i'll never win those
possession is half the law
i had my routines before all y'all
your whole life is coming apart at the seams
you ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines
see, i'm a city slicker
i, i ain't no townie
right now, i wish i had another hash brownie
and like ricky always said, you've got to toke and pass
or mookie's gonna' kick your motherfucking ass
try to take what isn't yours like a god damn rat
see i, personally, i wouldn't even wanna' go out like that
i'm a writer, a poet, a genius, i know it
i don't buy cheeba, i grow it
("i'm a farmer")
people always trying to get next to me
i had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
i smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
because i had to deal with a money-hungry miser
had a 'caine-filled kool with my man, rush rush
saw my teeth fall in the sink when i started to brush
you be doing nose candy on the bowie coke mirror
my girl asked for some, but i pretended not to hear her
you can't deny me, you always want to try me
yo, you're just gonna get your ass kicked
homeboy, throw in the towel
your girl got dicked by ricky powell
the godfather of soul in the belly of the beast
smoking that dust at st. anthony's feast
all the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
sitting in the white house pulling their peters
buy my cheeba from the cop down the street
the only cop with a rope chain when he's walking the beat
so like a sneaky pouch time-bomb ticking
a-like the beat to my rhyme just kicking
space cake cookies
i discover who i am
i'm a dusted old bummy hurdy gurdy man
five-oh caught me, now i'm going to the mountains
said good-bye to my girl, my lawyer and accountants
my mind is kinda rhyming, and i think i oughta think
so i'm rockin' all the rhymes, and i'll have another drink
so the lights are flashing, my mind is spinning
i feel like it is always the beginning
of another rhyme
i'm rapping, emceeing, i rock
you ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped...
listen, all you new yorkers
brooklyn, bronx, queens and staten
from the battery to the top of manhattan
asian, middle-eastern and latin
black, white, new york you make it happen
brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers
writers, prize fighters and wall street traders
we come together on the subway cars
diversity unified, whoever you are
we're doing fine on the one and nine line
on the l we're doin' swell
on the number ten bus we fight and fuss
cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must
i remember when the deuce was all porno flicks
running home after school to play pixx
at lunch i'd go to blimpies down on montague street
and hit the fulton street mall for the sneakers on my feet
dear new york, i hope you're doing well
i know a lot's happened and you've been through hell
so, we give thanks for providing a home
through your gates at ellis island we passed in droves
brooklyn, bronx, queens, and staten
from the battery to the top of manhattan
asian, middle-eastern and latin
black, white, new york you make it happen
the l.i.e., the bqe
hippies at the band shell with the lsd
get my bvd's from vim
you know i'm reppin' manhattan the best i can
stopped off at bleeker bob's got thrown out
sneakin' in at 4:00 am after going out
you didn't rob me in the park at diana ross
but everybody started looting when the light went off
from the south south bronx, on out to queensbridge
from hollis queens right down to bay ridge
from castle hill to the lower east side
from 1010 wins to live at five
dear new york, this is a love letter
to you and how you brought us together
we can't say enough about all you do
cause in the city we're ourselves and electric, too
brooklyn, bronx, queens, and staten
from the battery to the top of manhattan
asian, middle-eastern, and latin
black, white, new york you make it happen
shout out the south bronx where my mom hails from
right next to high bridge across from harlem
to the grand concourse where my mom and dad met
before they moved on down to the upper west
i see you're still strong after all that's gone on
life long we dedicate this song
just a little something to show some respect
to the city that blends and mends and tests
since 9/11, we're still livin'
and lovin’, life we've been given
ain't nothing gonna' take that away from us
were lookin' pretty and gritty cause in the city we trust
dear new york, i know a lot has changed
2 towers down, but you're still in the game
home to the many, rejecting no one
accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from
brooklyn, bronx, queens, and staten
from the battery to the top of manhattan
asian, middle-eastern, and latin
black, white, new york you make it happen

johnny ryall is the bum on my stoop
i gave him fifty cents to buy some soup
he knows the time with the fresh gucci watch
he's even more over than my mayor, ed koch
washing windows on the bowery at a quarter to four
'cause he ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more
livin' on borrowed time and borrowed money
sleepin' in the street, there ain't a damn thing funny
with the hand-me-down food, and the hand-me-down clothes
a rockabilly past of which nobody knows
makes his home all over the place
he goes to sleep by falling down on his face
sometimes known as the leader of the homeless
sometimes drunk, and he's always phoneless
sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box
he's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks
well...
johnny ryall, johnny ryall
kickin' uptown, kickin' downtown, kickin' crosstown
johnny ryall, johnny ryall
he drinks where he lies, he's covered with flies
he's got the hand me down pumas and the tie dyes
well, you go upstate, and you get your head together
thunderbird is the word, and you're light as a feather
detox at the flop house, no booze allowed
remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd
memphis is where he's from (in tennessee)
he lives in the street, but he's no bum
he's a rockabilly star from the days of old
he used to have teeth all filled with gold
he got a platinum voice, but only gold records
on the bass was boots and on the drums was checkers
luis vuitton with the gucci guitar
johnny ryall
who do you think you are?
johnny ryall, johnny ryall
drinkin' night train, drinkin' o.e
johnny ryall, johnny ryall
one, two, three, four
one, two, three, four
one, two, three, four
one, two, three...
donald trump and donald tramp living in the men's shelter
wonder bread bag shoes and singing "helter skelter"
he asks for a dollar, you know what it's for
man, bottle after bottle, he always needs more
he's no less important than you working class stiffs
he drinks a lot of liquor, but he don't drink piss
he paid his dues playing the blues
he claims that he wrote the "blue suede shoes"
elvis shaved his head when he went into the army
that's right, y'all, his name is johnny, kick it
johnny ryall, johnny ryall
johnny ryall, johnny ryall
check the cool wax!

he'll tweak your ass across the cross fade
so watch your back when he takes the stage (stage) (woo!)
or he'll send you off on a naked rampage
three mc's and one dj
we be getting down with no delay
mix master mike, what'cha got to say?
("bug out!" "to!" "the mic" "all the time!")
sweet and sour like a tangerine
fresh like a box of krispy kreme
kenny rogers' "gambler" is my gambling theme
mix master mike with the scratch routine
always up in in it and in the know (know)
you know we break it down going toe to toe
the bass is booming from down below
ed norton is chillin with mario (woo-wee!)
well, my name is adrock, i'm a scorpio

i'm known to mop, i'm known to glow (glow)
but don't get mad when we gots to go
three mcs and one dj
we be getting down with no delay
mix master mike, what'cha got to say?
("gotta, gotta," "gotta get down!")

three mc's and one dj
we be getting down with no delay
mix master mike, what'cha got to say?
("god damn, that dj made my day")
("you came off with that one, joe
oh, my goodness")
mic check, mic check
 (beastie boys)
one (one), two (two), three (three)
too many rappers, and there's still not enough mcs
it goes three (three), two (two), one (one)
mca, adrock, mike d, that's how we get it done
like ladies and gents, attention
nas in the house with beastie boys
we can turn it out
perpetrators, we can point 'em out
so if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out
yo, i been in the game since before you was born
i might still be mcing even after you're gone
strange thought, i know, but my skills still grow
the 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so
on and on until the crack of dawn
until the year 3000 and beyond
stay up all night, and i mc and never die
cause death is the cousin of sleep
because i'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie
strawberry letter 23 like shuggie
oh my god, just look at me
grandpa been rappin' since '83
i'm supersonic like j.j. fad
got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag
don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad
all these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs
i have carte blanche, the vagabond
nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund
i'm no killa, but compared to you, i'm more real'a
you ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer
a slug peeler, you're not
mafioso, no
you ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner
i ain't tryin' to hear your racket
you work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat
you wear that jacket
how many rappers must get dissed
gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this
i start to reminisce, ooh, when i miss
the real hip hop with which i persist
like rum in mojitos
bullets and banditos
matzoh balls in soup
jackets and troop
yes, y'all, this is one for the history books
nasty nas, what's the word?
count it off on the hook
cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain
to blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
my lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister
so get your hologram on off-a wolf blitzer
too many rappers to shake a stick at
i oughta charge a tax for every weak rap i had to listen to
cause we be makin' stacks like stax records
my squad, we gotta pact -we're never coming wack
to all you crab rappers and hackers
and circuit benders tweaked on splenda
i take the cake, i stole the mold
the golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold
and why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?
sniffin', buffin', huffin'
and mean muggin' with a blimpie bluffin
back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'
i'm broader than broadway, i was the project hallway
dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day
i'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay
and when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this
by the way, i have a strong fetish for christian louboutin steppers
i hear russian blonde's the wettest
but anyway, i better pay homage to my fellas
and that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?
mike d, the man of mystery
history in the makin', and now we're takin'
titles, awards, and accolades
scarin' the competition as i sharpen my blades
we come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
like pen and paper, like picasso and canvases
rockin' stadiums and shitty bars
go back in time, send a fax from my car
hello brooklyn!
new york, new york it's a hell of a town
you know the bronx is up, and i'm brooklyn down
because they don't know my name only know my initials
building bombs in the attic for elected officials
i quit my job, i cut my hair
you know, i cut my boss because i don't care
you tried to get slick, you bust a little chuckle
you're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
'cause being as fly as me is something that you never thought of
you'll be stickin' up old ladies with the handgun or the sawed-off
i'm a buffalo soldier, broader than broadway
keep keepin' on, i don't care what they say
i play my stereo loud, i disturb my neighbors
i want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
'cause i am the holder of the three-pack bonanza
if you open the book, then you will get your hand slapped
i am the keeper of the three-pack bonanza
if you ask a question, then you shall get the answer
her breast, i saw, i reached, i felt
m, o-n, e-y, the belt
i stay at home, just like a hermit
i got the jammy, but i don't got the permit (you know why)
you got a boyfriend, and his name is nick
annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick
i ride around town 'cause my ride is fly
i shot a man in brooklyn ("just to watch him die")
let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
it's never old school all brand new
so everybody catch the bugaloo flu
not like a fever not like a cold
the beats are clear the rhymes are bold
so don't see a doctor or see a nurse
just listen to the music first things first
first of all get off the wall
it's time to party so have a ball
we slowed it on down so get the hell up
like a volcano, i'll erupt
we got determination bass and highs
white castle fries only come in one size
what you see is what you get
and you ain't seen nothing yet
so let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
i do not sing but i make a def song
you could live your whole life and i hope you live long
on the gong show, we won't get gonged
we're the beastie boys not cheech and chong
strong as a ox fresh out the box
the crowd is so live they're coming in flocks
and when we go on the crowd goes off
it's all hard rock there's nothing soft
let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
cod
so let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
and let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
now we not only rock the house but we house the rock
we don't stroll but we roll straight to the top
mca, adrock, mike d makes three
and we can do it like this in the place to be
when i'm recorded you'll be rewarded
i know my song is def cause you all applauded
not pcp or lsd just me, mike d, in the place to be
this is not free you must pay a fee
cash on delivery like a cod
so let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
and let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
the beat is slow in order to dance
i wanna hear "i do"s and no "i can't"s
first move your leg and then your arms
it's not fast and nervous this dance is calm
it's truly stable and you ought to be able
to dance to the record when it's on the turntable
so let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
and let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
and let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
and let it flow let yourself go
slow and low that is the tempo
yo...yo...yo...he-hello...he-hello...yo...hello

time, time, time, time
it's times like this when i just can't stop
can't wind your body without the body rock
got schemes, schematics, blue prints on file
you got to have dreams to make it all worthwhile
so as i take my time and realign
i wonder what it is i hope to find
i don't mean to brag, i don't mean to boast
but i'm intercontinental when i eat french toast
adrock--woo!--with the new edition
gettin' on down for the year 2000
a slight distraction can get you paid
and when it comes to that type shit, i paved the way
bboys to the early morn
bgirls be rockin' on and on
bgirls to the break of dawn
bboys be rockin' on and on
hey...hey
dogs love me cause i'm crazy sniffable
i bet you never knew, i got the ill peripheral
in your home, i'm cloned, i'm on your headphones
i love it when you spazz out all alone
cause i'm that fool that broke the key
i'm unlockable so don't check me
i got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind
the sky is falling and i'm fallin' behind
so i synthesize sounds as i patch my brain
insane mind games move quick like flames
so now i wonder how sometimes you never know
who be rockin y'all in stere-ereo
in stere-ereo, in stere-ereo, in stereo
ladies and gentlemen
a no time like the present to work shit out
that's what we're going on and on and on about
i'm not fakin', just makin' beats in the dungeon
keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent
no shame in my game just par for the path
i try to hone my craft because at hand's the task
but i find i'm not playing with a full deck
i'm up to my neck like toulouse lautrec
all i want to know is when is checkout time
so i could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme
and when i'm with my man, shadi rock, at the gates
we'll be rockin' rhythms over disco breaks
bboys to the early morn
bgirls be rockin' on and on
bgirls to the break of dawn
bboys be rockin' on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on...
hubo una vez un gran rey que tenía muchas tierras, un castillo y también un amor

emcee for what i am, and do
the a is for adam, and the lyrics... true
so as i pray and hope, that the message is sent
and i am living in the dreams that i have dreamt
because i'm down with the three, the unstoppable three
me and adam and d were born to emcee
and my body and soul and mind are pure
not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
just lyrics from i to you, recited
arrested, bailed, but cuffed and indicted
enter the arena as i take the center stage
the lights set low, and the night has come of age
take the microphone in hand as i am a professional
speak my knowledge to the crowd, and the ed is special
for i am the bard, and i am the last one
i am the king, and this is my castle
dwell in realms of now, but vidi those of the past
seen a glimpse from ahead, and i don't think it's gonna last
and you can bet your ass
i drop the l when i'm skiin'
i'm smokin' and peakin'
i put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
can't stop the mindfuck when it's rollin' along
can't stop the smooth running when the shit's running strong
broke my bindings, the lion with wings
preaching his words in the b-boy sing
i am one with myself, as i turn to thee
prefer the dreams to the reality
i prefer my life, don't need no other man's wife
don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
but it's good to have a turn to be a king for a day
or for a week, or for a year, or for a year and a day
come what may...
i'm fishin' in my boat, and i'm fishing for trout
mix the bass ale with the guinness stout
fishing for a line inside my brain
and looking out at the world through my window pane
every day has many colors 'cause the glass is stained
everything has changed but remains the same
so once again the mirror raised, and i see myself as clear as day
and i'm going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
feeling as though somebody, somewhere, is testing me
he who sees the end from the beginning of time
looking forward through all the ages is, was, and always shall be
check the prophetic sections of the pages
ez mike with the disco dave
he goes by the name of the d-d-d-disco dave
disco dave, disco dave, disco dave

like a garbage bag full, overflowing (please) now it's leaking
rapunzel, rapunzel, let down your hair
so i can climb up and get into your underwear
you rat soup eating, test cheating, no business punk
you're insecure, born in the junkyard with the junk
you've gone wet-look crazy and messed with your head
you fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head
you're all mixed up, like pasta primavera
yo, why'd you throw that chair at geraldo rivera, man?
cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor
so get that money out of your ass, you whore
well, i brought her upstairs onto the roof
i dogged your wife, and she is a doofus

why you wanna beat that brat with a bat?
why you wanna treat your girl like that?
living in the rat race, smoking rat weed
well, you reap what you sow when you plant the seed
bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto
got more louie than phillip rizzuto
what goes around comes around

you're so ugly
you're a ponyass motherfucker
why don't you get a haircut, farm boy?
fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
barnyard stoats raid the pen
if you don't shoot 'em, they'll do it again
fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
farmer joe fucks a cow
he likes it so much, he sucks a sow
now you
everyday i'm going to school
i wish i could be satisfied
but it's hogwash
fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
now fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
barnyard bob mows the field
sees how much wheat will yield
fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
now fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
barnyard stoats raid the pen
if you don't shoot 'em, they'll do it again
and everyday i'm going to school
i wish that i could find gratitude
but it's hogwash
fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
now fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
barnyard stoats raid the pen
if you don't shoot 'em, they'll do it again
fuck the chickens, i don't like milk

fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
now fuck the chickens, i don't like milk
now me
everyday i'm riding to school
i'm learning a bunch of brainwash
it's hogwash
it's 4am, i've got the hasenpfeffer ale
i've got nothing to lose, so i'm pissing on the third rail
groggy-eyed and fried, and i'm headed for the station
d-train ride to coney island vacation
this one’s… dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1-train
they'll be kicking out windows, high on cocaine
and then i jump the turnstile, i lost my last token
riding between the cars, pissing, smoking
head for the last car, fluorescent light blackout
policeman told my homeboy, "yo, put that crack out"
you know you light up when the lights go down
and then you read the new york post, fulton street, downtown
same faces every day, but you don't know their names
party people going places on the d train
{stop that train, i wanna get off...}
check it
trench coat, wingtip, going to work
and you'll be pullin a train like you're captain kirk
pickpocket gangsters, payin' their debts
i caught a bullet in the lung from bernhard goetz
overworked and underpaid, starin' at the floor
prostitute's spandex caught in the slide doors
now you're stuck between the stations, it seems like an eternity
sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
$50.00 fine for disturbing the peace
the neck, tortoise, your lees are creased
hot cup of coffee, and the donuts are dunkin
friday night and jamaica queens funkin'
elevated platform, i'm never gonna conform
riding over the diner where i always get my toast warm
bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
over the loudspeaker about the hard times
sat across from a man readin el diario
riding the train down from the el barrio
went from the station, to orange julius
i bought a hot dog from who? george drakoulias
good times gone and you missed them
what's gone wrong in your system?
things they bounce, like a spalding
what'd you think? did you miss your calling?
it's so free, this kind of feeling
it's like life, it's so appealing
when you've got so much to say
it's called gratitude, and that's right
good times gone, but you feed it
hate's grown strong, you feel you need it
just one thing, do you know you
what you think? that the world owes you?
what's gonna’ set you free
look inside and you'll see
when you've got so much to say
it's called gratitude, and that's right
{uh thank you ladies and gentlemen, this next song is a blast
and i gotta say we are having a ball up here tonight
and when you're ready and...}
shabba doo, shabba dee
shabba dee, shabba doo
which of you schnooks took my rhyme book?
look, give it back, you're wicky-wack
with your ticky-tack calls…  didn't touch you at all
i didn't touch your hand — man, you know it’s all ball
you sold a few records but don't get slick
cause you used a corked bat to get those hits
you've been in the game, your career is long
but when you break it down you've only got 2 songs
mc's are like clay pigeons when i'm shootin' skeet
i just yell pull and mike drops the beat
you people call yourselves mc's but you're garbage men
takin' out the trash when you pull out the pen
and if you don't like it, then hey fuck you!
i read about you up on page 6
they was trashin' your ass it's sad you're getting dissed
now talk about your face now don't get pissed
but i suggest you see a dermatologist
i keep that hot sauce hot not mild and weak
it's gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak
i've got billions and billions of rhymes to flex
cause i've got more rhymes than carl sagan's got turtlenecks
your rhymes are fake like a canal street watch
you're hearing me and you're like, "oh my god its sasquatch!"
i'm walkin' on water while you're stepping in shit
so put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit
and if you don't like it, then hey fuck you!
so put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
so put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
so put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
so put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
and if you don't like it, then hey fuck you!
sucker mc’s, it's me they're resenting
in the animal kingdom, they call it presenting
with the dipsy-doodle, the kit and caboodle
the truth is brutal, your grandma's kugel
kings county is my stomping ground
the albee square mall, brooklyn, downtown
so don't ask me to wine and dine ya
i'm from brooklyn, you're from regina
you're like foghorn leghorn, yosemite sam
you're just yellin' and wildin' wondering who i am
with those lies you're telling you're like toucan sam
but my style's impregnable like the hoover dam
and if you don't like it, then hey, fuck you!
and if you don't like it, then hey, fuck you!
w-how, what a loser!

‘cause i can flip a rhyme off the tip of my tongue
yeah, i be switching up the rhythm like the rhyme's a piece of chewing gum
now i might chew, but i don't bite
my ideas are mine when i begin to write
in my sleep i’ll be thinking 'bout beats and
getting on the mic and busting some treats and
sportin’ the crazy funky threads that you've never even seen before
what i’m lackin’ from the mackin’ i can find at the thrift store
i won't scuff nor scuffle, just grin as they walk by
take time to rhyme for a girl i hear talk fly
down some papaya, down with the revolution
always wear my goggles, ‘cause there's so much pollution
i can do the freak, the patty duke, and the spank
gotta free the funky fish from the funky fish tanks
i’ll sell my house, sell my car, and i’ll sell all my stuff
"i’m going back to new york city, i do believe i’ve had enough"
whipped-whipped-whipped cream
whipped-whipped-whipped cream

there's no better or worse between you and me
but i rock the mic so viciously
like pins and needles and words that sting
at the blink of an eye i will do my thing
it's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins
like diggin' down deep in the record bins
everybody gettin' down make no mistake
nothing sounds quite like an 8...0...8
money makin', money money makin (manhattan!)
super disco, disco breakin'
money makin', money money makin (manhattan!)
super disco, disco breakin'

beatsie-beatsie boys gettin' live on the spot
puttin' all types of shame in the game you got
we keep the party moving to the broad day light
g-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright
time's an illusion as the moments race by
too fast to really grasp, though we may try
deny 'til we die, ooh my-my
these thoughts that mislead and then multiply
well, second by second and minute by minute
it's like lotto, you have to be in it to win it
shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise
lies tax to the max and they'll be feeling those vibes
so tell me what you need that you have got
fiending on power will make your blood clot
it starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
that's why, we can't all just get along
we're all connected like a lego set
one equals one together like a croquette
whether we have or have not yet met
well, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat
beatsie-beatsie boys gettin' live on the spot
puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
we keep the party moving to the broad daylight
g-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright
non-stop hip-hop, non-stop hip-hop
non-stop hip-hop, non-stop hip-hop

right about now i'd like to dedicate this song
out to my main homey, mike d
a'ight, let's kick it
ready... go
get on the mic, get-get on the mic
just get on the mic, get on the mic, mike!
let's be real, and don't cloud the issue
the rhymes are rope, an emcee you must listen to
people say that they been missin' me and missin' you
get on the mic, and let's show them like we used to
well, you say fuck that, yo, holmes, fuck this
i'm the king adwhammy and you're dick butkus
one half science and another half soul
nicknamed mike d, not fat morton jelly roll
got busy in 'frisco, fooled around in fresno
got over on your girlie 'cause you know she never says no
so just get on the mic, just get on the mic
just get on the mic, get on the mic, mike!
well, mike d is a special individual
pullin' out knots and pullin' in residuals
go to the movies, get the rolos
the cholos ridin' slow and low
mike on the mic and bust with the solo
mike, my stromy, don't be so selfish
get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish
{at the fever}
what's pleasing to the eye
in the delusion of my sight
is not what i find when i reach into the light
i have lost my mind
i'm walking through time
deluded as the next guy
pretending and hoping to find
that distant peace of mind
i don't know
who does know?
there is no
where to go
it's not so simple as i try to wish
but then again what is?
there is no other worthy quest
so on i go
i don't know
who does know?
there is no
where to go
i don't know
who does know?
where to go
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
as i develop the awakening mind
i praise the buddhas as they shine
i bow before you as i travel my path
to join your ranks, i make my full-time task
for the sake of all beings i seek
the enlightened mind that i know i'll reap
respect to shantideva and all the others
who brought down the dharma for the sisters and brothers
i give thanks for this world as a place to learn
and for this human body that i know i've earned
and my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
for without them, there would be no place to learn what i'm seeing
there's nothing here that's not been said before
but i put it down now so that i'll be sure
to solidify my own views
and i'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too
if others disrespect me or give me flak
i'll stop and think before i react
knowing that they're going through insecure stages
i'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
i'll see it as a chance to help the other person
nip it in the bud before it can worsen
a chance for me to be strong and sure
as i think on the buddhas who have come before
as i praise and respect the good they've done
knowing love can conquer hate in every situation
we need other people in order to create
the circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate
situations that bring up our deepest fears
so we can work to release them until they're cleared
therefore it only makes sense
to thank our enemies despite their intent
the bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
a strength from within to go the length
seeing others are as important as myself
i strive for a happiness of mental wealth
with the interconnectedness that we share as one
every action that we take affects everyone
so in deciding for what a situation calls
there is a path for the good for all
i try to make my every action for that highest good
with the altruistic wish to achieve buddhahood
so i pledge here before everyone who's listening
to try to make my every action for the good of all beings
for the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond
i vow to do my best, to do no harm
and in times of doubt, i can think on the dharma
and the enlightened ones who've graduated samsara

 for such a long while, there's been such a longin'
 but now the sun is shinin', let's roll back the awnin'
move-move your body
 this is a type of kinda like a formal dedication
 givin' out a shout
 for much inspiration
 all i ever really want to do is get nice
get loose and goof a little slice of life
 sendin' out love to all corners of the land
 i jump up on the stage and take the mic in my hand
 i'm not playin' the role
 just being who i am
 and if you try to dis me, i couldn't give a damn
cause i'm rockin'
rockin'
rockin'
rock-rock, rockin'
yeah, get down
rock-rock, rock on
rock-rock, rock on
rock-rock, rock on
mic-mic, mic control
mic-mic, mic control
mic-mic-mic, mic control
yeah, can you get my drift?
 bass from the back of my car feels soothin'
 eight bazookas is what i'm usin'
 i'm mike d, and it's been proven
 i love it when i see the party people just movin'
 strapped on my ear goggles and what did i see?
 but the music brought the people into harmony
uh, beastie boys, santigold
let's do this, y'all
santigold
let's go!
santigold:
it's hot here, gotta say it's so
i got you right where i want
got an honest face so you turn your back
when in doubt, run up your attack
at one time you were slick and your grill was cold
and now funny how the shit gets old
you can run, you can run, but it will catch up
like now, see me, i'll show you up
now you wanna get back when you had your shine
but you run the same thing every time when you rhyme
can't stop, won't stop, no compromise
it's a house of cards built out of lies
coming down like a bird floating on the mist
turn on the track, back track, and twist
you work hard to climb the list
twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift
i know the danger of a man
who's been to hell and back again (danger)
can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
don't play no game that i can't win (danger)
you're caught now by the skin you're in
in a bind now, your thoughts go to all your sins
hits much harder back, better count on that
i tell you what we know always holds us back
now you mutter and you stutter and you putter don't stop
i got in your heart and i shook you up
in a bind, now you're caught by the fear setting in
choked on the thought that you done it again
i keep the competition in check
you draft, your plans, at your drafting desk
you try to play to win but now you lost
like clams with no tartar sauce
scheming in the attic
thought you had it
so dramatic
i got the stats, mathematics
automatic, systematic
she's super bad now
what'cha, what'cha want now?
i know the danger of a man (that's danger)
who's been to hell and back again (danger)
can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
don't play no game that i can't win (danger)
don't play no game that i can't win (danger)
don't play no game that i can't win (that's danger)
don't play no game that i can't win (danger, danger)
don't play no game that i can't win (that's danger)
i know the danger of a man (that's danger)
who's been to hell and back again (danger)
can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
don't play no game that i can't win (danger)
don't play no game that i can't win
don't play no game that i can't win
here's another one for y'all to peep
it's called m-i-k-e on the m-i-c
see... i met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
i laid the bait, and then she took the tackle
had too much to drink at the red lobster
now the room is spinnin' 'round like the blades of a helicopter
i never met a girl that was too finicky
if the press has their way, then they're going to finish me
you might know this, but you've never been this, see?
if i ate spinach i'd be called spinach d
i shed light like cats shed fur
ride around town like i'm raymond burr
i'm so high that they call me your highness
so if you don't know me, then pardon my shyness
i live in the village, wherever i go i walk to
i keep my friends around so i have someone to talk to
i play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it
{"it's a trip... it's got a funky beat
and i can bug out to it!"}
you can't, you won't and you don't stop
mike d come on and rock the sure shot
i've got the brand new doo-doo guaranteed like yoo hoo

i've got the savior faire with the unique rhyme and
i keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and
strictly hand held is the style i go

top notch is my stock on the soap box
i've got more rhymes than i'v got grey hairs
and that's alot because i've got my share
i've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
got to straighten my thoughts, i'm thinking too much sick shit
everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
i've got to step back, i've got to contemplate
i'm like lee perry, i'm very
on rock the microphone and then i'm gone

mca come and rock the sure shot
i want to say a little something that's long overdue
the disrespect to women has got to be through
to all the mothers and sisters and the wives and friends
i want to offer my love and respect to the end

butcher me on the court
too many elbows to report

bill laimbeer motherf*cker, it's time for you to die

i kick it root down
i put my root down
it's not a put down
i put my foot down
and then i make some love, i put my root down
like sweetie pie by the stone alliance
everbody knows i'm known for dropping science
i'm electric like dick hyman
i guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin'
never let you down with the stereo sound
so mike, get on the mic and turn it out
we're talking root down, i put my boot down
and if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down
i said root down, it's time to scoot down
i'm a step up to the mic in my goose down
come up representing from the upper west
money makin' putting me to the test
sometimes i feel as though i've been blessed
because i'm doing what i want so i never rest
well, i'm not coming out goofy like the fruit of the loom guys
just strutting like the meters with the look-ka py py
'cause downtown brooklyn is where i was born
but when the snow is falling, then i'm gone
you might think that i'm a fanatic
a phone call from utah and i'm throwing a panic
but we break it from the root when we kick it on down
jimmy smith is my man, i want to give him a pound
ad rock don't stop, just get on the mic with the tic and the toc
i'll fill you with the f*ckin' rim like brim
i'm walking down your block and you say that's him
there goes the guy with the funky sound
the beastie boys you know we come to get down
because i've got the flow where i grab my dick
and say oh my god, that's the funky shit
so i'm going to pass the mic and cause a panic
the original nasal kid is doing damage
every morning i took the train to high street station
doing homework on the train, what a f*cked up situation
on the way back up hearing battle tapes
through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes
like harlem world battles on the zulu beat show
it's kool moe d vs. busy bee there's one you should know
enough of that, i just want to give some respect due
m.c.a. grab the mic and the ma bell will connect you
bob marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
"if dancin' prays to the lord then i shall feel alright"
i'm feeling good to play a little music
tears running down my face 'cause i love to do it
and no one can stop this flow from flowing on
a flow master in disaster with a sound that's gone
i'll give a little shout out to my dad and mom
for bringing me into this world and so on
i can't stand it i know you planned it
i'm gonna set it straight, this watergate
i can't stand rocking when i'm in here
because your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
so while you sit back and wonder why
i got this f*cking thorn in my side
oh my, it's a mirage
i'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage
so listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
you'll shut me down with a push of your button?
but yo i'm out and i'm gone
i'll tell you now i keep it on and on
'cause what you see you might not get
and we can bet so don't you get souped yet
you're scheming on a thing that's a mirage
i'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage
why; our backs are now against the wall
listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
i can't stand it, i know you planned it
but i'm gonna set it straight this watergate
but i can't stand rockin' when i'm in this place
because i feel disgrace because you're all in my face
but make no mistakes and switch up my channel
i'm buddy rich when i fly off the handle
what could it be, it's a mirage
you're scheming on a thing that's sabotage
1-2 1-2 keep it on
listen to the shit because we kick it until dawn
listen to the abstract got it going on
listen to the ladies come on and let me spawn
all your eggs then you go up the river
listen to the abstract that freaky nigga
i'm ad rock and i shock and i tick and i tock
and i can't stop with the body rock
see i've got heart like john starks
hitting mad sparks
pass me the mic
and i'll be rocking the whole park
i'm the m to the c to the a and it's a must
the rhymes that we bust on the topic on lust
and my moms is not butt, but f*ck it
let me get down to the rhythm
yes i'm getting funky and i'm shooting all my jism
like john holmes, the x-rated nigga
listen to the shit 'cause i'm the ill figure
nobody's getting any bigger than this
get it together, get it together
phone is ringing, oh my god
get it together
see what's happening
ad rock's down with the ione
listen to the shit because both of them is boney
got to do it like this like chachi and joanie
because she's the cheese and i'm the macaroni
so why all the fight and why all the fuss
because i ain't got no dust
yea, you know i'm getting silly
i've got a grandma hazel and a grandma tilly
grand royal prez and i'm also a member
born on the cusp in the month of november
i do the patty duke in case you don't remember
well, i freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender
well, i'm long gone word is born
don't need a mother f*cking fool telling me right from wrong
i don't think i'm slick nor do i play like i'm hard
but i'm a drive the lane like i was evan bernhard
and i've working on my game because life is taxing
got to get it together and see what's happening
get it together, get it together
get it together
see what's happening
i go one two like my name was biz mark
but i had to do the shit just let me embark
on the lyric and the noun and the verb
let's kick the shit off 'cause yo, i'm not the herb
well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
the moog with the funk for your derriere
while we're on that topic, yes i like to mention
when it comes to boning i'm representing
spacing, zoning, talkin' on the phone and
my brain is roaming and i don't know where it's going
talking lots of shit a little tweaking on the weekend
i've got to get him by the reigns because i know that i'm freaking
well, i'm a funky skull and i'm a scorpio
and when i get my flow i'm dr on the go
so q-tip, what you on the mic for
because i had to talk about the times that i rhyme
and when m.c.s come in my face, i'm like mace
because i back them off with the quills
nigga 'cause i tell you, nigga 'cause i'll keep you under prills
resting on nine one one sixteenth ave off the farmes boulevard
i'm from manhattan m.c.a.'s from brooklyn
yea, m.c.a., your shit be cooking
praying mantis on the court and i can't be beat
so, yo tip, what's up with the boot on your feet
i've got the timbos on the toes and this is how it goes
oh one two, oh my god
one two, oh my god, i've got some shit
i've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit
never ever ever smoking crack
never ever ever f*cking wack
i eat the f*ckin' pineapple now & laters
listen to me now, don't listen to me later
f*ck it 'cause i know i didn't make it f*ckin' rhyme for real
but, yo technically i'm as hard as steel
gonna get it together, watch it, gonna get it together ma bell
i'm like ma bell, i've got the ill communications
i can hear the trumpets blowing screaming out the end of time
look around and listen and you'll see every sign
the waters are polluted as the forests are cut down
bombing and drilling deep below the ground
check the prophecies from around the world
and look around now as it all unfurls
look into yourself and see what goes on
get a feeling in your heart of the right from wrong
because the mother earth needs to be respected
been far from too long that she's been neglected
race against race, such a foolish waste
it's like cutting off your nose to spite your face
and at the end of the wars, what was the cost
it's clear that the earth was the one who lost
we are one with her as she is one with us
it's unreal how she is treated so unjust
as our planet grows smaller each and every day
everyone affecting everyone in every way
we're all citizens of the world community
all here together and we're searching for unity
over the years, i've grown and changed so much
things i know now years ago, i couldn't touch
there are things i've done that i wouldn't do again
but i'm glad that i did 'cause i've learned from them
i just try to stay present right here, right now
no worries, no fears and without any doubts
it's about time
'cause in these times, these changing times
a transition is occuring and i am not blind
as the pendlum swings a new age we enter
and with every swing, it draws closer to the center
yes the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love
things must run their course so we push and we shove
but we're here to work it out in one way or another
to find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another
and the true key is a trust in self
for when i trust myself, i fear no one else
i took control of my life, just as anyone can
i want everyone to see it's in the palm of your hand
the past is gone, the future yet unborn
but right here and now is where it all goes on
i know we can fix it and it's not too late
i give respect to king and his nonviolent ways
i dream and i hope and i won't forget
someday i'm going to visit on a free tibet
someday i'm going to see us all joined as one
and it would be too bad to blow it up before we're done
'cause we long behind the rage learning from the pain
the love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain
i'm sending loving light to all that is
to all creation and the life we live
i'm not preaching bull shit, just speaking my mind
'cause i'm here now and it's about time
"when two are served, you may begin to eat"
gene futterman
because i grab the microphone and i pick it up
and then i f*ck it up and then i turn it in
and then i turn it out, got the body rockin' sound
and then you know i'm gonna get down and
eat a scooby snack and take disco nap
because i'm shopping at sears, 'cause i don't buy at the gap
sending this one out to all the funky inspirations
pretty purdie on the drums with the beat relations
well, i'm working on rhymes, they're coming line by line
trying to put what i feel into word and rhymes
i've got a feeling coming on, i've got to make some shit
a little something stupid, for the twisted and sick
because i drive like a maniac on the streets
and i don't give f*ck 'cause i've got the beats
got my nuts swingin' from left to right and
right to left and i'm death defying
alright hear this
alright hear this
i spin my fortune on a wheel like sajak
here's the payback keep going strong like since the way back
i try to be myself but i lose track
'cause the shit gets complicated now i've got to get back
as we learn to breed love for one another
in these times of melying cultures
i give respect for what's been borrowed and lent
i know this music comes down from african descent
because i don't need a magic potion
let me talk about back field in motion
my girls got cheeks for weeks and i'm happy
you know i'm a sneak like my old grand pappy
i gotta give thanks to my man archie shep
for staying true to inspiration and i don't half step
so i kick out the jams and tell you who i am
and i talk to the people like les mccann
i ask god for a rhyme or two
a little something for the wise as well as the fool
a little something to affect a little taste of change
for the together and the strong as well as the dearanged
i'll do you right like bobby knight
and then i'm rapping on the mic to the broadway light
stomp my hands, i clap my feet and
i'm bugging off yusef lateef
i got a match to my ass and i'm a keep it lit
i need to get some cash, call my accountant britt
i'm rushing around town taking care of my functions
always got one more thing so forget about function
we create this world and the problems go on
create our lives and the things that go wrong
so to the deaf, the blind, look around and listen
to what it is you want and for what you're wishing
moon me!
so, just sit back and max and relax
off tracks that i kick, come on and give it up
'causei get funky like diaper rash
and you know i'm mad spunky and i'm making cash
i've got sex rhymes like victoria's got secrets
to all you porne peepers who are trying to peep this
i'm like al goldstein, i'm all about screwing
lead my team to sixty wins like my man pat ewing
like getting shot out the barrel of a wave
like virgin pow on the peaks of a.k
like a sound that to the depths of the soul
well that's the feeling that i make my goal
a little wine with my dinner so i'm in the grape ape
i feel like a winner when i make a mix tape
because i get ill when i'm on the pause button
and i get my fill and you can't say nothing
more soul on this train then don cornelious
got the mad subwoofer pumping bass for your anus
just getting on the mic at the monthly function
wires hitting switches connecting at the junction
perlman's got beats and it ain't no secret
dante found his shit but you know he freaked it
and so the story goes on and on
down in s.d. 50 'till early morning
like the black birds i'm a do it fluid
building rhymes like buildings, like a stonehenge druid
step up and get enlightened, educating my mind
i play the tape forward, it's not time to rewind
step inside the mother f*cker and i get my flow on
amalgamating styles so i've got something to grow on
season's change when it comes their time
falls brings the winter and on back to springtime
well, it's the king ad rock and that's who i am
listen all of y'all i'm not the son of sam
'cause i'm thin and i don't grin
but check it out people 'cause i love to go and swim
caught up on the phone fiber optic distraction
information super highway got the brain contraction
i'm the kung fu master vs. the sumo wrestler
got the beats in manhatten you can hear in westchester
well, my mother was born out in coney island
raised on the l.e.s. manhatten island
my dad camo out from detroit and they had me
and back on through ellis island goes through the family tree
well, i'm a six point seven on the richter scale
i've got rhymes gallot and then i never fail
like gravy to potatos, luke to darth vader
i'm a souped up sucker and i'll see you all later
you see me coming down the block with the funky cuts
you say mike d. and i say mic these nuts
i've got attractions like i'm elvis costello
adam yauch grab the mic 'cause you know you're my mellow
well when i get it into the zone
i'm gonna take it to a place where it's all one
my shit is on and the rhyme style's kicking
my brain is flowing honest like abe lincoln
'cause i'm the f*ckin' rythm ace with the rhyme selection
listen all y'all i rap with perfection
because i got the mother f*ckin' old school flavor
that you savor so watch your behavior
talking other dimensions, levels higher
why did billy joel say we didn't start the fire
take you to another realm, another level
i've got the funky rhymes but i'm not the funky devil
i step from minute to minute, lifetime to lifetime
step from stage to stage to see it all unwind
slowly but surely i seek to find my mind
and every wall that i face is of my own desig
glendale boulevard boulevard
glendale boulevard is where i'm at
it's where i'm at, where i live
check it out because my head is like a siv
and we turn it out
drink a six pack and then you play som ball
walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall
add on two joints and then he starts to sweat
two hundred seventy five punds that you can't forget
heart attack, heart attack man
spend all your money on your health insurance plan
heart attack, heart attack man
keep on getting bigger because you know that you can
why do you force yourself on top of that girl
laugh with all your buddies because it's a man's man's world
someday that shit will come back to you
you've been throwing your weight around and
your shit is through
heart attack, heart attack man
going nowhere, got no master plan
heart attack, heart attack man
heart attack
weighs in at two seventy five
yeh my man is lucky to be alive
smokin' and drinkin' too
my man the heart attack man is gonna be running over you
got no god damn respect
had to put the big big bitch-ass in check
heart attack, heart attack man
lungs full of tar and a stomach full of spam
heart attack, heart attack man
time to change your ways heart attack man
what do we know about partying or anything else?
i don't get blind i don't drink wine
i took a sledge hammer and i broke my nine
because my record is mine, word is born i rhyme
and everey day i write the book down line by line
i'm feeling good when i do it like this
so come on and turn it up because you can't resist
because i'm back with another track wich you lack
'cause things is wack and that's a fact
because i'm on time, you're shouting rewind
you know it's ad rock that's blowing your mind
my shit is rough and you know it is so damn tough
i'm getting intense, not talking nonsese
i made up my mind, not sitting on the fence
i don't always know the right from the wrong
i do my best to figure it out and work it out in the long
i try to do a lot more than i can chew
balance out my ambition's what i've got to do
because you hide in broad day light, a parasite
a hypocrite, you take a peek quick
you turn your nose up, you think you're high up
you play it real safe and now your shit's fake
i seen you hawking and then you clock my style
and then you try to play it off like you think you're wild
d.i.y. that means do it yourself
i don't sit around waiting for someone's help
don't sit back and say good enough
keep on striving, reinventing but keeping it off
the cuff
so kick the level up cuhootnified
mackadocius vibes positively fortified
i'm throwing rhymes down kicking them downtown
traveling high speed through the underground
i kick it free style, make it worth your while
i've got shelves of rhymes that i keep on file
i'm feeling good now back home again
new york city is the city that i feel at home in
a blast from the grasshoff awhile it's been
stepping into the future again
i'm straight from the 88 to 93 to 94, i'm out the door
step into the party with the fila fresh gear
people looking at me like i was david koresh here
kicking rhymes from the heart 'cause that's where i'm at
f*ck the bullshit, be it far from me to pop that
in the search for truth, i go a lot of ways
there's not a lot of peace, that i find these days
i try to stay cool, i try to stay calm
but my life is getting hectic like a smoke bomb
so i'll say it like the group huggy bear
there's a boy-grrrl revolution of wich you should be aware
you can't dis me, it ain't worth it, b
you put yourself down and you don't even see
cause i don't play that, i know who i am
for a minute, i did but now i'm back again
i'm feeling strong see, trust myself g
well i stopped smoking cheeba
and that was part of the key
we've got fire, we need water
there ain't no water so i guess i ought to
leave you broke in a comatose state of mind
and i'm blind and i'm working overtime, so check it
i keep my rhymes in a little black book
and i know you want to take another look
as i develop the awakening mind i praise the buddha as they shine
i bow before you as i travel my path to join your ranks
i make my full time task
for the sake of all beings i seek
the enlighted mind that i know i'll reap
respect to shantideva and all the others
who brought down the darma for sisters and brothers
i give thanks for this world as a place to learn
and for this human body that i know i've earned
and my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
for without them there would be no place to learn what i'm seeing
there's nothing here that's not been said before
but i put it down now so i'll be sure
to solidify my own views and i'll be glad if it helps
anyone else out too
if others disrespect me or give me flack
i'll stop and think before i react
knowing that they're going through insecure stages
i'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
i'll see it as a chance to help the other person
nip it in the bud before it can worsen
a change for me to be strong and sure
as i think on the buddhas who have come before
as i praise and respect the good they've done
knowing only love can conquer in every situation
we need other people in order to create
the circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate
situations that bring up our deepest fears
so we can work to release them until they're cleared
therefore, it only makes sense
to thank our enemies despite their intent
the bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
a strength from within to go the length
seeing others are as important as myself
i strive for a happiness of mental wealth
with the interconnectedness that we share as one
every action that we take affects everyone
so in deciding for what a situation calls
there is a path for the good for all
i try to make my every action for that highest good
with the altruistic wish to achive buddhahood
so i pledge here before everyone who's listening
to try to make my every action for the good of all beings
for the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond
i vow to do my best to do no harm
and in times of doubt i can think on the dharma
and the enlightened ones who've graduated samsara
the best in men's clothing
call paul's boutique, ask for janice
the number is, ah, 718-498-1043
that's paul's boutique, and they're in brooklyn
now my name is adrock, i've got a story to tell

i'll take you to task, everyone of y'all draftsman
i'm rehashin' and ain't maskin'
bringin' the beat back, and keepin' it lastin'

i'm party crashin' so you better batten
down those hatches stop procrastinwell i'm mike d with a story to tell
and when i rock the crowd, the crowd we all yell
and when i get the feeling, i feel the feel swell
cause when i start to rhyme, i rhyme the rhyme well
went to the top and never went pop and
came back down but still not stopping
i'm not even asking, "yo, what's cracking?"
serving emcees on a platter like baked alaskan
so start packin', cause i'm back in
the game of hip-hop representin' manhattan
now push the pause button, then start ducking
shhhhh, you heard me like i'm e.f. hutton

once upon a time up on this mic
mc's be really workin' on what they write
with the sound delight we rock all night
and yes we're gonna party for the right to fight
we're international like matt takei
rock the mic from munich out to taipei
still around the way is where we'll stay
say what we mean, mean what we say
trajectories from the past are taking their toll
and what we do now is future molding
columbine bowling, childhood stolen
we need a bit more gun controlling
right-right-now-now; what is going on?
we-we-gotta-gotta; get it goin' on
be-be-fore-fore; it's too far gone
we gotta work together it's been too long
when i get on you scream, "hoo tight!"
rockin' this flow i could go all night
i'm not here to fight, or incite
i'm like the beach in the bahamas make you feel alright
i'm getting kind of tired of the situation
the u.s. attacking other nations
and narration, on every station
false elation's got me losing my patience
i'm a funky-ass jew and i'm on my way
and yes i got to say fuck the kkk
and oh yeah hey, how about today?
if you want to set if off then let me hear you say
right-right-now-now; what is going on?
we-we-gotta-gotta; get it goin' on
be-be-fore-fore; it's too far gone
we gotta work together it's been too long
i went to get a loan and they asked my race
i wrote down human inside the space
it's a disgrace how they try to debase
it ain't the banks damn business how my lineage trace
now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise
i'm an iron chef when i slice and dice
with the rhyme precise, the word is nice
so please pass me the riunite on ice
well let's go to work and not get berserk
cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt
try to smooth it out like levert
keep the mind on alert and not revert
right-right-now-now; what is going on?
we-we-gotta-gotta; get it goin' on
be-be-fore-fore; it's too far gone
we gotta work together it's been too long
{alright, he's scratching it right now
cuttin' the record back and forth against the needle
back and forth, back and forth, makin' it scratch
but let me tell you something
don't try it at home with your dad's stereo
only under hip-hop supervision, alright?}
{alright hear this
so you wanna be an mc, huh?
alright hear this
so you wanna be an mc, huh?}
because i grab the microphone and i pick it up
and then i fuck it up and then i turn it in
and then i turn it out, got the body rockin' sound
and then you know i’m gonna get down
eat a scooby snack and take disco nap
because i’m shopping at sears, cause i don't buy at the gap
sending this one out to all the funky inspirations
pretty purdie on the drums with the beat relations
well, i’m working on rhymes, they're coming line by line
trying to put what i feel into word and rhymes
i've got a feeling coming on, i’ve got to make some shit
a little something stupid, for the twisted and sick
because i drive like a maniac on the streets
and i don't give a fuck cause i’ve got the beats
got my nuts swingin' from left to right and
right to left and i’m death defying
{alright hear this
so you wanna be an mc, huh?
alright hear this
so you wanna be an mc, huh?}
i spin my fortune on a wheel like sajak
here's "the payback;" keep going strong, like since the way-back
i try to be myself but i lose track
because the shit gets complicated, now i’ve got to get back
as we learn to breed love for one another
in these times of melding cultures
i give respect for what's been borrowed and lent
i know this music comes down from african descent
because i don't need a magic potion
let me talk about backfield in motion
my girls got cheeks for weeks and i’m happy
you know i’m a sneak like my old grand pappy
well i gotta give thanks to my man, archie shepp
for staying true to inspiration and i don't half step
so i kick out the jams and tell you who i am
and i talk to the people like les mccann
{alright hear this
so you wanna be an mc, huh?
alright hear this
so you wanna be an mc, huh?
alright hear this
alright hear this}
i ask god for a rhyme or two
a little somethin' for the wise as well as the fool
a little somethin' to effect a little taste of change
for the together and strong as well as the deranged
i'll do you right like bobby knight
and then i’m rappin’ on the mic to the broadway light
stomp my hands, i clap my feet and
i'm buggin' off yusef lateef
i got a match to my ass and i’ma keep it lit
and well i need to get some cash, call my accountant britt
i'm rushin' around town takin' care of my functions
always got one more thing so forget about function
we create this world and the problems go on
create our lives and the things that go wrong
so to the deaf, the blind look around and listen
to what it is you want and for what you're wishin'
{alright hear this
oh yeah
so you wanna be an mc, huh?
alright hear this
so you wanna be an mc, huh?
alright hear this}
boom, yeah, the world mash up
well, things get hectic quick
from the satellite dish to your joy stick
it's the night of the living cable box
wires coming up from around the block
remote control to change the station
but that won't change your situation
have you seen what i mean
i'm the little gnome that's in your dreams
so i say this rhyme built by design
to take you beyond space and time
said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
the man pushing buttons on remote control
re-mote, control
remote control
until your back's up against the wall
you never know yourself that much at all
so you've got to share your love with a friend
that's all that you've got left in the end
living in this city of pure confusion
people misled by their own illusion
all this action, no satisfaction
we're all linked together like a chain reaction
play or fold, love is bold
what is the future that will unfold?
some like it hot, others like it cold
but we all want to hold the remote control
re-mote, control
re-mote, control
re-mote, control
re-mote, control
things get hectic quick
all of a sudden i'm in the thick
too much drama all around
distractions booming in sensurround
like a rainy day's earth it won't sit still
sliding on down a hill
sometimes life, it seems to stall
so never be ungrateful y'all
so i got a little something for your pay per view
like don king, i've got the crazy hair do
we've got cameras on mars on space patrol
controlled on earth by remote control
"uh, funky baby
lay it on me now
not so hard, man"
yo…
i've got chinese eyes and chinese suits (lay it on me now)
smokin' much buddha and smokin' much boots
more updated on the hip-hop lingo (not so hard, man)
my favorite new york knick was harthorne wingo
met a girl at a party, and i gave her my card
man, you know that it said napoleon bonaparte (lay it on me now)
peepin' out the colors, i be buggin' on cezanne
they call me mike d, joe blow, the lover man
well, your face turns red as your glass of wine
that you spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time (lay it on me now)
girl, you should be with me, you should drop that bum
'cause i got more flavor than fruit stripe gum
with that big round butt of yours
i'd like to butter your muffin--i'm not bluffin'
serve you on a platter like thanksgiving stuffin'
("and what it")
stuffing, stuffing
stuff it, buddy
{*scratching: "aw yeah!"*}
there's a girl over there {*"aw yeah!"*}
with long brown hair {*"aw yeah!"*}
i took her to the place...
i threw the mattress in her face...
took off her shirt {"*fresh"*}
took off her bra...
took off her pants {"*fresh"*}
you know what i saw {"wick wick wack!"}
{*all laughing*}
i don't like your attitude, boy
what makes you feel
and why you gotta be
like you got the right
to look her up and down?
what makes this world
so sick and evil?
i, i don't know
what makes you feel
like you've got whip appeal?
who made you the judge and jury?
ain't you never heard of privacy?
what makes this world
so sick and evil?
you figure it out
you figure it out
you figure it out

my style is iller than the goblins in "troll 2"
cause i'm the type of mc with the most pizzazz
you're stealing my book like i was grandmaster caz
got rhymes about antihistamines and analgesics
rhyme about expectorants, y'all don't see it
soothsayer, not a player, rhyme sayer extreme
burn like fire when i step on the scene
i've got shark's teeth so i can bite your head
i've got tiger's claws that'll scratch you dead
i've got wings like a dragon when i'm flying above
shoot venom from my eyes when it's time to get rough
so step back and check yourself
this mc's got weapons that'll ruin your health
so if you're feeling strong, then reach for yours
my book is my shield and my mic is my sword, sword, sword...
long burn the fire

like a big mac attack on your gut and that's wack, my friend
i'm a maxer relaxer and i'm chillin'
i take that shit serious like jerome to grillin'
i burn you to a crisp, sucker, back up off the toaster
i make you sick like at kenny rogers roaster
see this rap thing is all about the braggadocio
i check my rear view, mcs ain't gettin' closer
people think i'm slow cause i'm just i'm underchallenged
see me, you're like, "man, that's remarkable talent"
live round the clock like disco donut
i'm like a tailor cause i got the thing sewn up
or a proctologist, i move asses
got so much heat that i fog your mom's glasses
proof is in the pudding and the pudding's in my pants
you heard me rappin' now watch me dance
long burn the fire
the truth shall set you free
save the date for when they hoist our number to the rafters
above the haters, you can hear our laughter
like willis reed or elton john
we done been in the game and our game's still on
it's not tic tac toe or operation
just holding it down like the gravitation
to all the heads that said, "no can do"
adrock's in the bath filled with chocolate fondue
straight up nuts like my name is mike bazzini
bonafide household name like sergio tacchini
"wasn't we here back on raising hell?"
running wild like rats in the taco bell
on the mic i spit, the match it's lit
mike dino, the jewish brad pitt
making music for librarians to burly jocks
the rapper mike d, known for my curly locks
oh
yeah
hey yo
this is a dedication to all you back stabbing biting mc's
scratching like you got fleas
know what i'm saying?
yo. we watchin' you son
we up on the roof
down in the celler
and up in the crawlspace
listen fool, i got my eye on you son
what?
there's a party going on in here for real
i got more product than ron popeil
so deal with that, troop; we're troopers
the only air time you get is on bloopers
beastie boys in the place, up in the space
so renovate or evacuate
you better think twice before you start flossin'
i been in your bathroom often
taking punk mc's out i'm all about
my to-do list today is turn the party out
getting hot in here, no room to breath
i got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep
no i'm not herman munster nor dr. spock
i go by the name of the king adrock
so here's a match my ass and your face
listen when i tell you, dog;
i'm in your crawl space
you're in front of my house and you know that's wack
bite my rhymes with a scanner from radio shack
you suckers try to front like you've got the force
but i'll slay like vader, sip you for a first course
don't even get me started on intercourse..
*ahhhh!*
don't step into my zone or even periphery
can't grab a hold of my style, it's too slippery
the way you act a fool, son, you can't erase
andyou running on your way like steeple chase
you tried to take my title, put it back in place
but now you're busted wearing panties and lace
steeling my style from my trophy case
but my drive's secure like on an army base
you're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase
but you ain't never gonna catch me;
i'm in your crawl space
schematics, blueprints and microfilm
calibrate your sonar when i'm in your realm
cause you know we're getting scarier and scarier
and this extends beyond the tri-state area
omnipresent and omnipotent
my rhymes are whales and yours are rodents
this means huge compared to very small
you look a little chilly, can i get you a shawl?
cause these rhymes are two hundred proof
they're like anvils lined up on a roof
waiting to drop on your corny melon
cause were not buying what you're selling
first you want to battle then you start to whine
you're looking hungry, it must be snack time
so run home where you feel safe
but don't sleep, cochese
i'm in your crawl space
butcher me on the court
too many elbows to report
now you're poking me in the eye
bill laimbeer motherfucker, it's time for you to die
tough guy, it's time to check yourself
dribbling the ball like the biz can be bad for your health
tough guy, what you gotta prove?
moving like an elephant, that's your favorite move
tough guy, your shit is going out
tough guy
box me out with your fat ass
throw me around like a bounce pass
you've got a tombstone hanging over your dick
cause a minor earthquake when you throw a moving pick
tough guy, you think you're like the shaq
keep running around, you'll catch a heart attack
tough guy, what are you giving me
the way you're playing ball, you'll stop me from living, b
tough guy, tough guy
tough guy, you're shit is weak
tough guy, you fucking freak
tough guy, i'll stick your shit
tough guy
jeb, get away from the bar-b-que, man
don, get the hell away from that thing
dunce, give me a kiss
won't you come and give me a kiss?
if you don't like the news then press eject
baby davis, getting older, can't take a rain check
it's time to let 'em know what we expect
stop building suv's, strung out on opec
hold up, wait up, you know, we come correct
you wanna change things up, well, hey, then get set
it's easier to sit back than stick out your neck
it's easier to break things than build it correct
we've got a president we didn't elect
the kyoto treaty he decided to neglect
and still the us just wants to flex
keep doin' that, what, we gonna break our necks
it takes a second to wreck it
it takes time to build
it takes a second to wreck it
it takes time to build
you gots to chill
ah, yo, hate-filled people wanna keep us in check
tearin' down each other is what they expect
if you want love, well, hey, that's a bet
we've got to give before we can get
waiting like a batter who is on deck
when it's time to wreck shop then shop i'll wreck
so let's calibrate and check our specs
we need a little shift on over towards the left
i don't really know but i suspect
i think it's due time that we inspect
how they get their information and their facts are checked?
another press conference someone's talking out their neck
it takes a second to wreck it
it takes time to build
it takes a second to wreck it
it takes time to build
you gots to chill
so step up to the window and place your bets
is the us gonna keep breaking necks
maybe it's time that we impeach tex
and the military muscle that he wants to flex
by the time bush is done what will be left
selling votes like e-pills at the discotheque
environmental destruction and the national debt
but plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest
what the real deal, why you can't connect?
why you hating people that you never met?
didn't your mama teach you to show some respect?
why not open your mind for a sec?
it takes a second to wreck it
it takes time to build
it takes a second to wreck it
it takes time to build
you gots to chill
it takes
it takes
it takes
it takes
it takes
it takes
{the idea is to keep the green alien landing craft from taking your humans from the ground and changing them into mutants
a mutant is very dangerous to you because he flies faster than you do and shoots at you}
how you feeling, ad-rock?
well, i'm feeling well
bonafide, qualified, with a story to tell
how you feeling, mike d?
well, i feel all good
all day it's how we play in the neighborhood
how you feeling, mca?
well, i feel right
i speak my words on the track cause the track sounds tight
well, if you're feeling good and you're feeling right
uh, somebody step up and grab the mic
now hello everybody and how you been?
it's ad-rock rappin' on the microphone again
i got grace, class, style, finesse, and debonair
murdalize motherfuckers cause i just don't care
the emcee whisperer, kinda like a trainer
i take sucker rappers, i put 'em through a strainer
like macaroni cause the shit sound cheesy
watch how it's done, boy, it looks easy
the non-stop, goin' off, kingpin, microphone boss
do my own thing, you can't afford the cost
of my style, take you through a turnstile
cause i'm live and direct, and i'm wicked and wild
because i'm back on a roll, got total control
i flow like the water out your toilet bowl
your style is cheap, boy, just like a dutch
you know you're not smokin' on the microphone much
there's a certain special talent that i never lack
huh-ha, huh-ha, and that's a fact
cause we shine like the chrome on a cadillac
you better break a wishbone cause we never wack
said we're never that and that is that
and we're the nonstop disco powerpack!
uh, that's right, we go all night
who gonna be next to bless the mic?
now this is the way we run it down
we're gettin' you high on the funky sound
this is the way we get it on
b-boys in the house 'til the break of dawn
see, i mix my style up like a cement mixer
smooth and fix ya, like a rhyme elixir
i said, "yo, sound man, make mike's mic louder"
don't make me sound cheap like a box of douche powder
i max and relax, champagne mojito
don't go commando, don't know bandito
je m'appelle michel pérignon
me and claude in the chateau and we got it going on
quincy's in the hot tub like it's '73
looking over his shoulder and he's looking at me
i'm all white in the face, towel around my waist
what's up with that watch inside that glass case?
i go to make my move, sneak out of the place
undetected, not leaving a trace
party's done, microphone's wrecked
wine's been drunk and heads been checked
i see one last profiterole and make my play
and pass the microphone to mca
nonstop, on the top, and you clock, when we rock
never fakin', no mistakin', we be makin' hip hop
(so c'mon everybody get down... yeah)
now there's a spot check, hit the deck count down
cause i'm a break it down for you, how we run it down
pound for pound, keep the bass lines round
i seen you watchin', clockin', jockin' my sound
but, for real, i'm real glad i grew up in hip hop
still got mad love for a record called "beat bop"
it meant a lot spinning on my walkman
shout out to the african bam
and to the s to the p the double o-n-y
the one mc who you can't deny
i'd listen to the records and they'd inspire
sit down to write and the pen breathes fire
construct a rhyme with specific intent
flowin' from the brain cells, right through the pen
and then i put the book down, grab ahold the mic
words flowin' so cold, turn water to ice
come through the wire, saturate the tape
you put me in the mix, nice it up with the plate
and then they press it on wax, sell it in the store
the dj spin the record out on the dance floor
comin' through the speakers to shake your eardrum
brain cells get lit, then you hear where we're comin' from
well, ad-rock (huh) get it on
we gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
mike d, (huh) get it on
we gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
mca, (a-yeah) get it on
we gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
beatsie boys in the house don't stop

"bet you're wondering what's been going on
bet you think i've almost lost my mind"
my dj's got the cuts and the beats are on
we're comin' with the limericks, and we're comin' strong
and the rhythm's on time, to every word and rhyme
when it comes to keep it real, i keep it really wrong
at the risk of sounding crass, i would like to mention
that i am well aware of your wack intentions
to usurp my prose, you so-and-so
it's my primary bone of contention
i tell you, everybody, i've had it
with all these people with static
i'll go insane if it don't rain
sucker mcs are problematic
i love it when you hit those switches
a curve ball's what my pitch is
so here we—here we come
like dum-ditty-dum
i keep all five boroughs in stitches
"you're right, man"
sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
sound, sounds sweeter through the echoplex
it'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
until you feel no pain inside your brain
all your worries are soothed by the sound effects
you read it in the post and the daily news
listen everybody lets show improve
don't let me begin about heroin
living six feet deep just ain't the move
we're giving you soul power
i like it sweet and sour
when it comes to rhymes and beat designs
i'm at the control tower
tell me what makes you so afraid
of all these people you say you hate
just give it one time for your mind
and let's try to negotiate
c'mon, let's try to negotiate
let's try to negotiate
"bet you're wondering what's been going on
bet you think i've almost lost my mind
bet you think i've almost lost my mind"
now what the blood clot, i rap a lot
what you gonna do when the beat goes drop?
whatcha talkin' 'bout, willis? who the illest?
you know my name's adam, stop callin' me phyllis
ya hear some fuss, you're like what's the clamor?
it's just me naked on the cover of glamour
a phenomenon, pandemonium
the club is blowing up like plutonium
what's all the fanfare, what's the to do
we're known to bring the hullabaloo
on stage or at the spa
guaranteed we bring the brouhaha
‘cause it's a brouhaha
‘cause it's a brouhaha
there's a commotion that's goin' down
i talk more shit than drown the clown
i'm like that freak from cirque du soleil
with my leg behind my head and a rhyme to say
ten nine eight seven six five four
get upon the mic and i'm a even the score
one two three, three to two one
don't carry a knife and i don't carry a gun
yo, we be making mountains out of cool whip
pass me the mint for the julep
tell me everybody where is the love
hey yo what's the motherfuckin' hubbub
‘cause it's a brouhaha
‘cause it's a brouhaha

you can dance if you want to leave your friends behind
but if they don't dance and then they won't dance
they can kiss my fuckin' ass
‘cause it's a brouhaha
‘cause it's a brouhaha
our evening began
in peter sichel's comfortable study
in his new york townhouse
where the candlelight was just right
the hi-fi was in the background
and the wine, was delicious
 what's the secret, peter?
 naturally, i'll say it's the wine
 mmmm, it does go well with the chicken!
delicious again, peter
i don't see things quite the same as i used to
as i live my life, i've got just me to be true to
when i find that i don't know about just what to do
i turn and look within—to see what i should do
now i'm not sure what it takes to be hip
a lot of people making music that to me ain't shit
so i ask creation for rhymes for this jam
gimme lickle solo and i'll take the mic stand
love vibe, love vibe, love vibe, love vibe
love vibe, love vibe, love vibe, love vibe
yeah, as the earth spins into a brand new day
i see the light on the horizon's not fading away
gonna shine from within, like a bright white sun
no need to hide and no place to run
got the vibrations of the music bringing light to your mind
so you can move and groove, and feel the beat of the time
sense the power in the air as it starts to move
you get a real good feeling that you just can't lose
love vibe
contemplation time
love vibe
intuition time
love vibe
evolution time
love vibe
resolution time
free your mind, it's time for good times
and let yourself move, it's a time to shine
spread your wings in the sky, feelin' good inside
breaking fool with no need to hide
i got the music cuttin' through me
takin' control of my soul
i can't hold back, i've got to let go
stand together (people come together now)
it's about time (we've got to get together now)
stand together (people come together now)
i said it's about time (we've got to get together now), come on
stand together (people come together now)
i said it's about time (we've got to get together, y'all)
i think we should stand together
whoahhh-ohhh
funky boss, funky boss, funky boss, funky boss
funky boss, funky boss, get off my back (hah, get it)
funky boss, funky boss, funky boss, funky boss
funky boss, funky boss, get off my back
what in the fuck is hap-pen-ning?
funky boss, funky boss, funky boss, funky boss
funky boss, funky boss, funky bald-ass boss
yeah, that's right
funky bald motherfuckers!
'cause everywhere gonna be nowhere
{children of the earth!}
well, i can hear the trumpets blowing, screaming out the end of time
look around and listen, and you'll see every sign
the waters are polluted as the forests are cut down
bombing and drilling deep below the ground
check the prophecies from around the world
and look around now as it all unfurls
look into yourself and see what goes on
get a feeling in your heart of the right from the wrong
because the mother earth needs to be respected
been far too long that she's been neglected
race against race, such a foolish waste
it's like cuttin' off your nose to spite your face
and at the end of the wars, what was the cost?
well, it's clear that the earth was the one who lost
we are one with her, as she is one with us
it's unreal how she is treated so unjust
as our planet grows smaller each and every day
everyone affecting everyone in every way
we're all citizens of the world community
all here together and we're searching for unity
over the years i've grown and changed so much
things i know now, years ago i couldn't touch
there are things i've done that i wouldn't do again
but i'm glad that i did cause i learned from them
i just try to stay present, right here, right now
no worries, no fears, and without any doubts
well, it's about time, it's about time
it's about time, it's about time, it's about time
cause in these times, these changing times
a transition is occurring, and i am not blind
as the pendulum swings, a new age we enter
and with every swing, it draws closer to the center
yes, the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love
things must run their course, so we push and we shove
but we're here to work it out, in one way or another
to find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another
but the true key is a trust in self
for when i trust myself, i fear no one else
i took control of my life just as anyone can
i want everyone to see it's in the palm of your hand
the past is gone, the future yet unborn
but right here and now is where it all goes on
i know we can fix it and it's not too late
i give respect to king and his nonviolent ways
i dream and i hope and i won't forget
someday i'm going to visit on a free tibet
someday i'm going to see us all joined as one
and it would be too bad to blow it up before we're done
cause we long behind the rage, learning from the pain
the love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain
i'm sending loving light to all that is
to all creation and the life we live
i'm not preaching bullshit, just speaking my mind
cause i'm here now and it's about time
well, it's about time, it's about time
it's about time, it's about time, it's about time
yeah, that's right!
it's time, to set the record straight
ain't nobody got to spell it for me
i said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
i said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
but if i have to i'll yell in your ear
time for livin', time for givin'
time for livin', time for givin'
time for livin', time for givin'
time for livin', time for givin'
check this out
ain't nobody got to spell it for me
i said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
i said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
but if i have to i'll yell in your ear
soul fire, soul fire
and we ain't got no water
we don't got no water
time for livin', time for givin'
no time for makin' up a monster to sell
time for livin', time for givin'
no time for makin' up a monster to sell
the shit with this bitch
yo, i said i'm calling you, b

mmmm yeah
a butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day
as i feel this reality gently fade away
riding on a thought to see where it's from
gliding through a memory of a time yet to come
smoke paints the air
swirling images through my mind
like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind
and i stand at the edge, cautiously awaiting
as time slips by
carefully navigating by the stars in the sky
and i sit
and i think to myself
and on the horizon, the sun light begins to climb
and it seems like it's been so long since he shined
but i'm sure it was only yesterday
a cold chill of fear cut through me
i felt my heart contract
to my mind i brought the image of light
and i expanded out of it
my fear was just a shadow
and then a voice spoke in my head
and she said, dark is not the opposite of light
it's the absence of light
and i thought to myself
she knows what she's talking about
and for a moment i knew what it was all about
i don't get blind, i don't drink wine
i took a sledge hammer and i broke my nine
because my life is mine, word is bond i rhyme
and every day i write the book down line by line
i'm feeling good when i do it like this
so come on and turn it up because you can't resist
because i'm back with another track in which you lack
cause things is wack and that's a fact
because i'm on time, you're shouting rewind
you know it's adrock that's blowing your mind
my shit is rough and you know it is so damn tough
i'm getting intense, not talking nonsense
i made up my mind, not sitting on the fence
i don't always know the right from the wrong
do my best to figure it out and work it out in the long
i try to do a lot, more than i can chew
i balance out my ambitions what i got to do
check it, better believe it y'all
check it, better believe it y'all
this is rough and tough
cause you hide in broad day light, a parasite
a hypocrite, you take a peek quick
you turn your nose up (what), you think you're high up (uh)
you play it real safe and now your shit's fake
i seen you hawking and then you clock my style
and then you try to play it off like you think you're wild
d.i.y., that means do it yourself
i don't sit around waitin' for someone's help
i don't sit back and say "good enough"
i keep on striving, reinventing, keepin' it off the cuff
so i kick the level up cuhootnified
mackadocius vibes, positively fortified
i'm throwing rhymes down, kickin' them downtown
traveling high speed through the underground
i kick it freestyle, make it worth your while
i've got shelves of rhymes that i keep on file
i'm feeling good now, back home again
well, new york city is the city that i feel at home in (woo)
a blast from the grasshoff, awhile it's been
stepping into the future again (yeah)
uh, and now i'm straight from 88
to 93 to 94, i'm out the door
step into the party with the fila fresh gear
people looking at me like i was david koresh here
kicking rhymes from the heart cause that's where i'm at
fuck the bullshit, be it far from me to pop that
in the search for truth, i go a lot of ways
there's not a lot of peace that i find these days
i try to stay cool, i try to stay calm
but my life is getting hectic like a smoke bomb
so i'll say it like the group huggy bear
there's a boy-girl revolution of which you should be aware
you can't dis me, it ain't worth it, b
you put yourself down and you don't even see
cause i don't play that, i know who i am
for a minute i did but now i'm back again
i'm feeling strong, see, trust myself, g
well, i stopped smoking cheeba and that was part of the key
we, we, we've got fire, we need water
there ain't no water, so i guess i ought to
leave you broke in a comatose state of mind
and i'm blind and i'm working overtime, so check it
i keep my rhymes in my little black book
and i know you wanna take another look
*this is rough and tough*
time is runnin', i'm passin', i'm passin' and runnin'
i'm runnin' and passin'
so you all better get right at this time
cause there might be no next time, y'all
(instrumental)
once again, i'm all wrapped up in me
my best friend's my own worst enemy
electricity and gravity
oh, my god, now take a look at me
my lifeline's run by at&t
they got their wires all up in me
is push and pull the way it's got to be?
once again, i'm all wrapped up in me
my best friend's my own worst enemy
electricity and gravity
once again, i'm all wrapped up in me
once again, i'm all wrapped up in me
once again, i'm all wrapped up in me
once again, i'm all wrapped up in me
you know, i wish that there was some way
that i could be outside playing basketball in the rain
and not get wet. now wouldn't that be great, hmm?
