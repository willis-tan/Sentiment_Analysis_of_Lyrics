coming out of my cage and i've been doing just fine
gotta, gotta be down because i want it all
it started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
it was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
now i'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
while he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
and it's all in my head, but she's touching his
chest now, he takes off her dress now
let me go
i just can't look, it's killing me
and taking control
jealousy, turning saints into the sea
swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
but it's just the price i pay, destiny is calling me
open up my eager eyes, 'cause i'm mr. brightside
i'm coming out of my cage and i've been doing just fine
gotta, gotta be down because i want it all
it started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
(it was only a kiss), it was only a kiss
now i'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab

i did my best to notice
when the call came down the line
up to the platform of surrender
i was brought but i was kind
and sometimes i get nervous
when i see an open door
close your eyes, clear your heart
cut the cord
are we human
or are we dancer?
my sign is vital
my hands are cold
and i'm on my knees
looking for the answer
are we human
or are we dancer?
pay my respects to grace and virtue
send my condolences to good
give my regards to soul and romance
they always did the best they could
and so long to devotion
you taught me everything i know
wave goodbye, wish me well
you've got to let me go
are we human
or are we dancer?
my sign is vital
my hands are cold
and i'm on my knees
looking for the answer
are we human or are we dancer?
will your system be alright
when you dream of home tonight?
there is no message we're receiving
let me know, is your heart still beating?
are we human
or are we dancer?
my sign is vital
my hands are cold
and i'm on my knees
looking for the answer
you've got to let me know
are we human
or are we dancer?
my sign is vital
my hands are cold

with all these things that i've done
all these things that i've done
(time, truth, and hearts)
if you can hold on
if you can hold on
you sit there in your heartache
waiting on some beautiful boy to
to save you from your old ways
you play forgiveness
watch it now, here he comes
he doesn't look a thing like jesus
but he talks like a gentlemen
like you imagined
when you were young
can we climb this mountain? i don't know
higher now than ever before
i know we can make it if we take it slow
let's take it easy
easy now, watch it go
we're burning down the highway skyline
on the back of a hurricane that started turning
when you were young
when you were young
and sometimes you close your eyes
and see the place where you used to live
when you were young
they say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
you don't have to drink right now
but you can dip your feet
every once in a little while
you sit there in your heartache
waiting on some beautiful boy to
to save you from your old ways
you play forgiveness
watch it now, here he comes
he doesn't look a thing like jesus
but he talks like a gentlemen
like you imagined
when you were young
(talks like a gentleman)
(like you imagined when)
when you were young
i said he doesn't look a thing like jesus
he doesn't look a thing like jesus
but more than you'll ever know
on the corner of main street
just trying to keep it in line
you say you wanna move on and
you say i'm falling behind
can you read my mind?
can you read my mind?
i never really gave up on
breaking out of this two-star town
i got the green light, i got a little fight
i'm gonna turn this thing around
can you read my mind? (oooh)
can you read my mind? (oooh)
the good old days, the honest man
the restless heart, the promised land
a subtle kiss that no one sees
a broken wrist and a big trapeze
oh, well, i don't mind if you don't mind
'cause i don't shine if you don't shine
before you go, can you read my mind?
it’s funny how you just break down
waiting on some sign
i pull up to the front of your driveway
with magic soaking my spine
can you read my mind? (oooh)
can you read my mind? (oooh)
the teenage queen, the loaded gun
the drop dead dream, the chosen one
a southern drawl, a world unseen
a city wall and a trampoline
oh, well, i don't mind, if you don't mind
'cause i don't shine if you don't shine
before you jump, tell me what you find
when you read my mind
slipping in my faith until i fall
he never returned that call
woman, open the door, don't let it sting
i wanna breathe that fire again
she said, "i don't mind, if you don't mind (i don't mind, if you don't mind)
'cause i don't shine if you don't shine" (i don't shine if you don't shine)
put your back on me, put your back on me (i don't mind, if you don't mind)
oh, put your back on me
oooh
the stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun
can you read my mind? (oooh oooh)
what have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
are your excuses any better than your senator's?
he held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
he did her dirty but no-one died
i saw sonny liston on the street last night
black-fisted and strong singing redemption song
he motioned me to the sky
i heard heaven and thunder cry
run for cover
run while you can, baby, don't look back
you gotta run for cover
don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
you know you're not the only one
and don't look back, just run for cover
what are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
you think by now you'd have an a in toxicology
it's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
it's even harder when the dirtbag's famous
i saw my mother on the street last night
all pretty and strong, singing 'the road is long'
i said 'momma i know you've tried'
but she fell on her knees and cried
run for cover
run while you can, baby, don't look back
you gotta run for cover
don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
i know you're not the only one
and don't look back, just run for cover
and there was nothing she wouldn't give
just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams
she's running, she's running
just to trust him
he got a big smile, he's fake news
just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose
run for cover
run while you can, baby, don't look back
you gotta run for cover
don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
you know you're not the only one
and don't look back, just run for cover
run
run
run for cover
it started with a low light
next thing i knew, they ripped me from my bed
and then they took my blood type
it left a strange impression in my head
you know that i was hoping
that i could leave this star-crossed world behind
but when they cut me open
i guess that changed my mind
and you know i might
have just flown too far from the floor this time
'cause they're calling me by my name
and they're zipping white light beams
disregarding bombs and satellites
that was the turning point
that was one lonely night
the storm maker says, "it ain't so bad"
the dream maker's gonna make you mad
the spaceman says, "everybody look down
it's all in your mind"
well now i'm back at home, and
i'm looking forward to this life i live
you know it's gonna haunt me
so hesitation to this life i give
you think you might cross over
you're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
you'd better look it over
before you make that leap
and you know i’m fine
but i hear those voices at night sometimes
they justify my claim
and the public don’t dwell on
my transmission ‘cause it wasn’t televised
but it was the turning point
oh, what a lonely night
the storm maker says, "it ain't so bad"
the dream maker's gonna make you mad
the spaceman says, "everybody look down
it's all in your mind"
the storm maker says, "it ain't so bad"
the dream maker's gonna make you mad
the spaceman says, "everybody look down
it's all in your mind"
my global position systems are vocally addressed
they say the nile used to run from east to west
they say the nile used to run
from east to west
i'm fine
but i hear those voices at night
sometimes
the storm maker says, "it ain't so bad"
the dream maker's gonna make you mad
the spaceman says, "everybody look down
it's all in your mind"
the storm maker says, "it ain't so bad"
the dream maker's gonna make you mad
the spaceman says, "everybody look down
it's all in your mind"
it's all in my mind
it's all in my mind
save some face, you know you've only got one
change your ways while you're young
boy, one day you'll be a man
oh, girl, he'll help you understand
smile like you mean it
smile like you mean it
looking back at sunsets on the east side
we lost track of the time
dreams aren't what they used to be
some things slide by so carelessly
smile like you mean it
smile like you mean it
and someone is calling my name
from the back of the restaurant
and someone is playing a game
in the house that i grew up in
and someone will drive her around
down the same streets that i did
on the same streets that i did
smile like you mean it
smile like you mean it
smile like you mean it
smile like you mean it
oh no, oh, no, no, no
oh no, oh, no, no, no
we took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same
we had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
she said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go
she couldn't scream while i held her close
i swore i'd never let her go
tell me what you wanna know
oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
there ain't no motive for this crime
jenny was a friend of mine
so come on, oh, come on, oh, come on, oh
i know my rights, i've been here all day and it's time
for me to go, so let me know if it's alright
i just can't take this, i swear i told you the truth
she couldn't scream while i held her close
i swore i'd never let her go
tell me what you wanna know
oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
and then you whisper in my ear
"i know what you're doing here"
so come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
there ain't no motive for this crime
jenny was a friend of mine
oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on, oh
blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
a blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
i'd been on her trail for a little while
but that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
a teenage rush
she said, "ain't we all just runaways? we got time"
but that ain't much
we can't wait till tomorrow
you got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
it's the one thing you can choose, oh!
we got engaged on a friday night
i swore on the head of our unborn child
that i could take care of the three of us
but i got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
it's in my blood
she said she might just runaway somewhere else
someplace good
we can't wait til tomorrow
you got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
it's the one thing you can choose
let's take a chance baby, we can't lose
ain't we all just runaways?
i knew it when i met you, i'm not going to let you runaway
i knew it when i held you, i wasn't letting go!
we used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
hold each other till the morning light
we used to laugh, now we only fight
baby are you lonesome now?
at night i come home after they go to sleep
like a stumbling ghost, i haunt these halls
there's a picture of us on our wedding day
i recognize the girl but i can't settle in these walls
we can't wait till tomorrow
oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
it's the last thing on my mind (why you want to hide it?)
i turn the engine over and my body just comes alive
ain't we all just runaways?
i knew it when i met you, i'm not going to let you runaway
i knew it when i held you, i wasn't letting go!
oh! oh! oh!
ain't we all just runaways?
yeah, runaways
ain't we all just runaways?
yeah
you were standing with your girlfriends in the street
falling back on forever, i wonder what you came to be
i was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
i never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirl's lies
and when i look back on these neon nights
the leather seats, the passage rite
i feel the heat, i see the light
from miss atomic bomb
making out we got the radio on
you're going to miss me when i'm gone
you're going to miss me when i'm gone
racing shadows through the moonlight
through the desert on a hot night
for a second there we won
we were innocent and young
cast out of the night
you got a foolish heart
so you took your place but the fall from grace
was the hardest part
it feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
you run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
you should have seen your little face, burning for love
holding on for your life
all that i wanted was a little touch
a little tenderness and truth, i didn't ask for much, no
talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time
miss atomic bomb
making out we've got the radio on
you're going to miss me when i'm gone
you're going to miss me when i'm gone
racing shadows through the moonlight
taking chances on a hot night
for a second there we won
we were innocent and young
the dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
but sometimes in dreams of impact i still hear
miss atomic bomb, i'm standing here
sweat on my skin
and this love that i've cradled
is wearing thin (miss atomic bomb)
but i'm standing here and you are too late
your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate
it feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
(it's so cruel)
you run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
(and you turn your back, you're so)
your soul was innocent
she kissed him and she painted it black (on a losing game)
you should have seen your little face
burning for love
(miss atomic bomb)
holding on for your life
but you can't survive (all that i wanted was a little touch)
when you want it all (a little tenderness and truth, i didn't ask for much)
there's another side (talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time)
wheels are turnin'
i remember when you were mine
just to reach you
baby, i'd stand in line
there's another world
we're livin' in tonight
and there's another heart
that's fadin' in the light
don't want your picture on my cell phone
i want you here with me
don't want your memories in my head, no
i want you here with me
spent the summer just layin' out in the sun
time seems to move so slowly, when you're taking it as it comes
maybe we were just too young
your body was tan and your hair was long
you shot me a smile and my cares were gone
fallin' in love filled my soul with fright
you said, "come on, babe, it'll be alright"
i must've been a fool to the bitter end
now i hold on to hope that i'll have you back again
i'd bargain and i'd fight
but there's another world you're livin' in tonight
don't want your picture on my cell phone
i want you here with me
i don't want your memory in my head, no
i want you here with me
well, i saw you in a restaurant the other day
and instead of walkin' towards you, i ran away (ran away)
i keep on waitin' for you
for you to come around
come around and say
i don't want your picture on my cell phone
i want you here with me
don't need those memories in my head, no
i want you here with me
ahhhhh
(here with me)
ahhhhh
(here with me)
and it came to pass, as jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. and when the pharisees saw this, they said unto his disciples, why eateth your master with publicans and senators? but when jesus heard that, he said unto them, they that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick
i walked into town with a message for my old man
i've got the last two chapters of matthew in my hand
steve painting houses while bobby went and gone insane
they buried my sister but daddy he stayed the same

don't give up on me
'cause i'm just in a rut
i'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up
can't keep my mind off of every little wrong
i see the mouths are open, but i can't hear the song
i've done my best to fill 'em, but the cracks are starting to spread
hey i won't blame you baby, go on turn your head
but don't give up on me
'cause i'm just in a rut
i'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up
i can't keep pretending this next stop isn't mine
the truth is on the table, someone's gotta sign
i've done my best defending, but the punches are starting to land
i'm sliding into something you won't understand
don't give up on me
'cause i'm just in a rut
i'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up
but don't give up on me
'cause i'm just in a rut
i'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up
so i'm handing you a memory
i hope you understand
that steadily reminds you of who i really am
this city's always breathing, i wish that it would die
the kickbacks and the bachelors, the fever for the velvet rope
the money from my mother's men
i'm not like her, you're not like them
i'll climb and i'll climb, i'll climb and i'll climb, i'll climb and i'll climb
i'll climb and i'll climb, i'll climb and i'll climb, i'll climb and i'll climb

a dustland fairytale beginning
with just another white trash county kiss
in '61, long brown hair and foolish eyes
he looked just like you'd want him to
some kind of slick chrome american prince
a blue jean serenade
moon river what'd you do to me
i don't believe you
saw cinderella in a party dress but
she was looking for a night gown
i saw the devil wrapping up his hands
he's getting ready for the showdown
i saw the minute that i turned away
i got my money on a pawn tonight
the change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
she said she'd always knew he'd come around
and the decades disappear like sinking ships, but we persevere
god gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know
the mind is poison
castles in the sky sit stranded vandalized
we're drawbridges closing
saw cinderella in a party dress
but she was looking for a nightgown
i saw the devil wrapping up his hands
he's getting ready for the showdown
i saw the ending when they turned the page
i threw my money and i ran away
straight to the valley of the great divide
out where the dreams all hide
out where the wind don't blow
out here the good girls die
and the sky won't snow
out here the bird don't sing
out here the field don't grow
out here the bell don't ring
out here the bell don't ring
out here the good girls die
now cinderella don't you go to sleep
it's such a bitter form of refuge
why don't you know the kingdom's under siege
and everybody needs you
is there still magic in the midnight sun
or did you leave it back in sixty-one
in the cadence of a young man's eyes
out where the dreams all hide
can't wipe the wind-blown smile from across my face
it's just the old man in me
washing his truck at the sinclair station
in the land of the free (ooh)
his mother, adeline's family, came on a ship
cut coal and planted a seed
down in them drift mines of pennsylvania
in the land of the free
land of the free, land of the free
in the land of the free
land of the free, land of the free
land of the free, land of the free
in the land of the free
(i'm standing crying)
when i go out in my car, i don't think twice
but if you're the wrong color skin (i'm standing, crying)
you grow up looking over both your shoulders
in the land of the free
and we got more people locked up than the rest of the world
right here in red, white and blue (i'm standing, crying)
incarceration's become big business
it's harvest time out on the avenue
land of the free, land of the free
in the land of the free
land of the free, land of the free
move on there's nothing to see
land of the free, land of the free
in the land of the free
oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
i'm standing, crying (oh-oh-oh-oh)
i'm standing, crying
so how many daughters, tell me, how many sons
do we have to have to put in the ground
before we just break down and face it:
we got a problem with guns? (oh-oh-oh-oh)
in the land of the free
down at the border, they're gonna put up a wall
concrete and rebar steel beams (i'm standing, crying)
high enough to keep all those filthy hands off
of our hopes and our dreams (i'm standing, crying)
people who just want the same things we do
in the land of the free
land of the free, land of the free
in the land of the free
land of the free, land of the free
land of the free, land of the free
in the land of the free
land of the free, land of the free
land of the free, land of the free

i drove through the desert last night
i carried the weight of our last fight
elvis singing don't be cruel, and i wonder if you feel it too
it's like we're going under
somewhere outside the lonely esmeralda county line
the question of my heart came to my mind
if i go on with you (by my side)
can it be the way it was?
when we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?
maybe a thief stole your heart
maybe we just drifted apart
i remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield
blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield
back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
that paradise is buried in the dust
if i go on with you (by my side)
can it be the way it was?
when we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?
all of our plans have fallen through
sometimes a dream don't come true
darling! darling!
if we go on
can it be the way it was
when we met did you forget all about them golden nights?
if i go on with you by my side
can it be the way it was
my heart is true, girl it's just you i'm thinking of
can it be the way it was?
maybe a thief stole your heart
i pack my case. i check my face
i look a little bit older
i look a little bit colder
with one deep breath, and one big step, i move a little bit closer
i move a little bit closer
for reasons unknown
i caught my stride
i flew and flied
i know if destiny’s kind, i’ve got the rest of my mind
but my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to
and my eyes, they don’t see you no more
and my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
and my eyes don’t recognize you no more
for reasons unknown
for reasons unknown
there was an open chair
we sat down in the open chair
i said if destiny’s kind, i’ve got the rest of my mind
but my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to
and my eyes, they don’t see you no more
and my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
and my eyes don’t recognize you at all
for reasons unknown
for reasons unknown
i said my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to and my eyes don’t recognize you no more
and my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
and my eyes don’t recognize you no more
for reasons unknown
for reasons unknown
for reasons unknown
for reasons unknown
lookin' out the window, out on the street
i don't know what happened, i'm out on my feet
i hear my mother calling my name
i still come running, but i ain't the same
you can change the channel, take the phone off the hook
avoid the headlines, but you'll never grow up, baby, if you don't look
when i saw him go down
felt like somebody lied
i had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
when i saw him go down
felt like somebody lied
i had to close my eyes just to stop the tears
you're used to winning, how did it feel?
could you hear the screaming? it was unreal
what did they pay you, what did it cost?
how long did it take you to know that you lost?
you can hit the showers, fill the place up with steam
close the curtains, but when you woke up, man it wasn't no dream
when i saw him go down
felt like somebody lied
i had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
when i saw him go down
felt like somebody lied
i had to close my eyes, close my eyes
just to stop the tears
lookin' out the window out on the street
my boy and his mother
and i think of me
feelin' the slip again
don't wanna fall
you said it was nothing, but maybe you're wrong
'cause when i saw him go down
felt like somebody lied
i had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
when i saw him go down
felt like somebody lied
i had to close my eyes just to stop the tears
(just to stop the tears)
(just to stop the tears)
nobody ever had a dream 'round here
but i don't really mind that it's starting to get to me
nobody ever pulls the seams round here
but i don't really mind that it's starting to get to me
i've got this energy beneath my feet
like something underground's gonna come up and carry me
i've got this sentimental heart that beats
but i don't really mind that it's starting to get to me now
why do you waste my time?
is the answer to the question on your mind
and i'm sick of all my judges
so scared of what they'll find
but i know that i can make it
as long as somebody takes me home
every now and then
well have you ever seen the lights?
have you ever seen the lights?
i took a shuttle on a shockwave ride
where people on the pen pull the trigger for accolades
i took a bullet and i looked inside it
running through my veins an american masquerade
i still remember grandma dixie's wake
i've never really known anybody to die before
red white and blue upon a birthday cake
my brother, he was born on the fourth of july and that's all
so why do you waste my time?
is the answer to the question on your mind
and i'm sick of all my judges
they're so scared of letting me shine
but i know that i can make it
as long as somebody takes me home
every now and then
every now and then
you know i see london, i see sam's town
holds my hand and let's my hair down
rolls that world right off my shoulder
i see london, i see sam's town now
step out into the indian dust
i can feel the cracks in my spirit
they're starting to bust
drive by your house, nobody's home
i'm trying to tell myself that i'm better off alone
all of my friends say i should move on
she's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
and all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
and it's a great big world, she's just another girl
another girl
i went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip
maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
i can't believe you're out there flying with someone else
now jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
i got an invitation but i didn't reply
tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
and give him all of my love
all of my friends say i should move on
she's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
and all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
and it's a great big world, she's just another girl
i could be reeling them in left and right
something's got a hold on me, tonight
well maybe all of my friends should confront
the fact that i don't want another girl
all of my friends say i should move on
all of my friends say
all of my friends say
all of my friends say
she's just another girl
now why can't i sleep at night
and why don't the moon look right
the sound's off but the tv's on
and it's a great big world
she's just another girl
don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
she's just another girl
all my friends say she's just another girl
another girl
we're building up a kingdom
we pray it never falls
i can lose my temper
you can put up walls
and i hate when it gets serious
it's like we're going blind
take the needle off the record
i can't stand another chorus
about juliet's control
over mystified mankind
but i can't get you out of mind
to get you out of my bed
to get you out of my heart
and my head
(oh, we're falling)
(oh, we're falling)
i stormed the gates of graceland
to make you realize
went back to back with springsteen
you turned and rolled your eyes
so i told you about mccartney
and that's a heavy name to drop
you say you don't need confirmation
but i don't know if i can stop
cause i can't get you out of my mind
to get you out of my bed
to get you out of my heart
and my head
(oh, we're falling)
(oh, we're falling)
oh we're falling
oh we're falling
oh we're falling
oh we're falling
oh we're falling
i tried going against my own soul's warning
but in the end, something just didn't feel right
oh, i tried diving even though the sky was storming
i just wanted to get back to where you are
if you could see through the banner of the sun
into eternity's eyes, like a vision reaching down to you
would you turn away?
what if it knew you by your name?
what kind of words would cut through the clutter of the whirlwind of these days?
i tried going against my own soul's warning
and in the end, something just didn't feel right
oh, i tried diving, even though the sky was storming
thunder heads were forming
but then i thought i could fly
and when i hit the ground
it made a messed up sound
and it kept on rattling through my days
and cutting up my nights like a goddamn knife
and it got me thinking, no matter how far
i just wanted to get back to where you are
i tried going against my own soul's warning
and in the end, something just didn't feel right
oh, i tried running from the memory and the mourning
but the penalty kept on pouring
and now i think i know why
'cause when i hit the ground
it made a messed up sound
and it kept on rattling through my days
and cutting up my nights like a goddamn knife
and it got me thinking no matter how far
i just wanted to get back to where you are
ooh, yeah
oh
ooh, yeah
oh, oh
once in a lifetime, the suffering of fools
to find our way home, to break in these bones
once in a lifetime (once in a lifetime)
once in a lifetime
oh, give me a shot at the night
give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
once in a lifetime, we're breaking all the rules
to find that our home, has long been out grown
throw me a life line, cause honey i've got nothing to lose
once in a lifetime (once in a lifetime)
once in a lifetime
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
look at my reflection in the mirror
underneath the power of the light
give me a shot at the night
give me a shot at the night
give me a shot at the night
i feel like i'm losing the fight
give me a shot at the night, some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
i know what you want
i'm gonna take you a midnight show tonight
if you can keep a secret
i got a blanket in the back seat on my mind
and a little place that sits beneath the sky
she turned her face to speak but no-one heard her cry
drive faster, boy
drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh
i know there's a hope
there's too many people trying to help me cope
you got a real short skirt
i wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah, yeah
we were just in time
let me take a little more off your mind
there's something in my head, somewhere in the back, saying
"we were just a good thing, we were such a good thing"
make it go away without a word
but promise me you'll stay and fix these things i've heard
oh, make it go away
drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh
oh, no
a crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
with jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
i took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
of stars in atmosphere and watched her disappear
into the midnight show
faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
oh no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no
if you can keep a secret
well, baby, i can keep it if you can keep a secret
if you can keep a secret, i can keep a secret
if you can keep a secret
well, baby, i can keep it if you can keep a secret
come with me
we took a back road
we're gonna look at the stars
we took a backroad in my car
down to the ocean
it’s only water and sand
and in the ocean we'll hold hands
but i don't really like you, apologetically dressed in the best, put on a heartbeat glide
without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky, and on the cold wet dirt i cry
and on the cold wet dirt i cry
don’t you wanna come with me? don’t you wanna feel my bones
on your bones?
it's only natural
a cinematic vision ensued
like the holiest dream
there's someone calling
an angel whispers my name
but the message relayed is the same:
"wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine."
but it's gone to the dogs in my mind
i always hear them when the dead of night
comes calling to save me from this fight
but they can never wrong this right
don't you wanna come with me? don't you wanna feel my bones
on your bones?
it's only natural
don’t you wanna swim with me? don’t you wanna feel my skin
on your skin?
it's only natural
(never had a lover)
i never had a lover
(never had soul)
i never had soul
(never had a good time)
and i never had a good time
(never got cold)
i never got gold
don't you wanna come with me? don't you wanna feel my bones
on your bones?
it's only natural
don't you wanna swim with me? don't you wanna feel my skin
on your skin?
it's only natural
don't you wanna come with me? don't you wanna feel my bones
on your bones?
it’s only natural
come and take a swim with me. don't you wanna feel my skin
on your skin?
it’s only natural
racey days help me through the hopeless haze
but my, oh, my
tragic eyes, i can't even recognize myself
behind
so if the answer is no
can i change your mind?
out again, a siren screams at half-past ten
and you won't let go
while i ignore, that we've both felt like this before
it starts to show
so if i have a chance
would you let me know?
why aren't you shaking?
step back in time
graciously taken
oh, you're too kind
and if the answer is no
can i change your mind?
we're all the same and love is blind
the sun is gone before it shines
and i said, if the answer is no
can i change your mind?
if the answer is no
can i change your mind?
remember rio and get down
like some other dj, in some other town
she's been trying to tell me to hold tight
but i've been waiting this whole night
but i've been down across a road or two
but now i've found the velvet sun
that shines on me and you
in the back, ah-ho, i can't crack
we're on top
it's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho
i can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
the day is breaking, we're still here
your body's shaking and it's clear
you really need it, so let go
and let me feed it, but you know
that i've been down across a road or two
but now i've found the velvet sun
that shines on me and you
in the back, ah-ho, i can't crack
we're on top
it's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho
i can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
we bring the bump to the grind, ah-ho
i don't mind, we're on top
it's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho
i can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
and we don't mean to satisfy tonight
so get your eyes off of my pride tonight
'cause i don't need to satisfy tonight
it's like a cigarette in the mouth
or a handshake in the doorway
i look at you and smile because i'm fine
and we don't mean to satisfy tonight
so get your eyes off of my pride tonight
'cause i don't need to satisfy tonight
it's like a cigarette in the mouth
or a handshake in the doorway
i look at you and smile because i'm fine now
i didn't see this comin', i admit it
but if you think i'll buckle, forget it
i told you that i'd be the one
i'll be there in the life to come
you think i lost my vision but i didn't
it sounds like heaven, but it isn't
through fields of amber we will run
somewhere in the life to come
this is not a shake down
let go of the blame
have a little faith in me, girl
just dropkick the shame
uncover your face, girl
let go of the blame
have a little faith in me
just drop kick the shame
call my name
call my name
if you call my name

leaves are fallin' down on the beautiful ground
i heard a story from the man in red
he said, "the leaves are fallin' down, such a beautiful sound
son, i think you'd better go ahead"
but you always hold your head up high
'cause it's a long, long, long way down
this town was meant for passing through
boy, it ain't nothin' new
now go and show 'em that the world stayed round
but it's a long, long, long way down
you better run for the hills before they burn
listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
i just want to show you what i know
and catch you when the current lets you go
or should i just get along with myself?
i never did get along with everybody else
i've been trying hard to do what's right
but you know i could stay here all night
and watch the clouds fall from the sky
well, this river is wild
this river is wild
run for the hills before they burn
listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
(i shake a little) sometimes i'm nervous when i talk
(i shake a little) sometimes i hate the line i walk
i just wanna to show you what i know
and catch you when the current lets you go
or should i just get along with myself?
i never did get along with everybody else
i've been trying hard to do what's right
but you know i could stay here all night
and watch the clouds fall from the sky
because this river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
this river is wild
now adam's taking bombs and he's stuck on his mom
because that bitch keeps trying to make him pray
he's with the hippie in the park, combing over the dark
just trying to get some of that little-girl play
you better run for the hills before they burn
listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
i just want to show you what i know
and catch you when the current lets you go
or should i get along with myself?
i never did get along with everybody else
i've been trying hard to do what's right
but you know i could stay here all night
and watch the clouds fall from the sky
the pain is hell in me tonight
because this river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
this river is wild
this river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
this river is wild
now the cars are everywhere, raisin' dust at the fairground
i don't think i ever seen so many headlights
but there's something pulling me
the circus and the crew, well, they're just passing through
making sure the merry still goes 'round
but it's a long, long, long way down
doo-doo, doo-doo
i believe in you and me
i'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
wrong until you make it right
and i won't forget you
at least i'll try and run, and run tonight
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
alright, alright, alright, alright
i wasn't shopping for a doll
to say the least, i thought i'd seen them all
but then you took me by surprise
i'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
i never knew, i never knew
so take your suitcase, 'cause i don't mind
and baby doll, i meant it every time
you don't need to compromise
i'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
i never knew, i never knew but it's alright, alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright
everything will be alright

believe me, natalie, listen, natalie
this is your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now
please believe me, natalie, listen natalie
this is your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now
forget what they said in soho, leave the "oh, no"s out
and believe me, natalie, listen natalie
this is your last chance
there is an old cliche under your monet, baby
remember the arch of roses right above your couch?
forget what they said in soho, leave the "oh, no"s out
yes, there is an old cliche under your monet, baby
you left the station now to the floor with speculation
what was it for?
in that old hallway, mom says, "why don't you stay?
you've been away for a long time"
believe me, natalie
this is your last chance to find a go-go
forget what they said in soho
and walk away
if my dreams for us can't get you through just one more day
it's alright by me
god, help me somehow
there's no time for survival left
the time is now
'cause this might be your last chance to disco, oh-oh, oh-oh
you lost faith in the human spirit
you walk around like a ghost
and your star-spangled heart
took a train for the coast
and when you shine, you're a hilltop mansion
so how'd you lose the light?
was it blown by the wind
in the still of the night?
you're up against the wall
up against the wall
there's something dying on the street
when they knock you down
you're gonna to get back on your feet
('cause you can't stop now)
i always saw you as a kind of keeper
a mother to a child
but your boys have grown soft
and your girls have gone wild
from the blue ridge to the black hills
to the redwood sky
the season may pass
but the dream doesn't die
now don't you drop the ball
up against the wall
there's something dying on the street
when they knock you down
you're gonna to get back on your feet
(but you can't stop now)
and when they break your heart
and when they cause your soul to mourn
remember what i said
"boy, you was battle born"
(but you can't stop now)
you was battle born
and when the night falls on the land
are you haunted by the sound?
it's going to take more than a hand
to turn this thing around
won't you lean it on me?
rescue, set me free
you're up against the wall (up against the wall)
there's something dying on the street
when they knock you down (up against the wall)
you're gonna to get back on your feet
('cause you can't stop now, 'cause you can't stop now)
and did they break your heart? (did they break your heart?)
and did they cause your soul to mourn? (cause your soul to mourn?)
remember what i said (remember what i said)
"boy, you was battle born" (you were battle born)
('cause you can't stop now, 'cause you can't stop now)
come on show your face (come on, show your face)
come on give us one more spark (give us one more spark)
we'll sing your song of fire (we'll sing your song of fire)
lest we fall into the dark (fall into the dark)
('cause you can't stop now, no, you can't stop now)
you never live, you never learn
you never shine if you never burn
a rising tide, the undertow
the famine and the overflow
well, turn away, welcome home
when i offer you survival
you say it's hard enough to live
it's not so bad, it's not so bad
how do you know that you're right?
i awoke on the roadside
in the land of the free ride
and i can't pull it any longer
the sun is beating down my neck
so i ran with the devil
left a trail of excuses
like a stone on the water
the elements decide my fate
watch it go
when i offer you survival
you say it's hard enough to live
don't tell me that it's over, stand up
poor and tired, but more than this
how do you know that you're right?
if you're not nervous anymore
it's not so bad, it's not so bad
i feel my vision slipping in and out of focus
but i'm pushing on for that horizon
i'm pushing on
now i've got that blowing wind against my face
so you sling rocks at the riptide
am i wrong or am i right?
i hit the bottom with a "huh!", quite strange
i get my glory in the desert rain
watch it go (when i offer you survival)
when i offer you survival
you say it's hard enough to live
and i'll tell you when it's over, shut up
poor and tired, but more than this
how do you know that you're right?
if you're not nervous anymore
it's not so bad, it's not so bad
higher and higher
we're gonna take it down to the wire
we're gonna make it out of the fire
higher and higher, higher and higher
we're gonna take it down to the wire
we're gonna make it out of the fire
higher and higher, higher and higher
we're gonna take it down to the wire
we're gonna make it out, whoa-oh-oh
higher and higher
it ain't hard to hold
when it shines like gold
you'll remember me
you're looking for a way out
i can feel it
come on, show me where it hurts
maybe i can heal it
your feelings are your own
now you keep them under lock and key
you got me driving through the streets
for an answer to the mystery
the willows still weep on charleston avenue
outside that vacant starlight motel
i see you laughing with your girlfriends
not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind
it was a matter of time
there's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface
just walking through the front door makes me nervous
it's creeping up the floorboards, got me wondering where i stand
i cannot put out the fire, i got a book of matches in my hand
when we first met, headstrong and filled with doubt
made just enough hustling tables that summer to take you out
i was falling back on forever
then you told me about your heart
you laid it on the line
laughing with your girlfriends
not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind
(you laid it on the line)
it was just a matter, it was a matter of time
we found ourselves a place
we belong in it forever
ain't that what it's all about?
make the promise and keep it
come hell or high water
we'd figure it out
it was the night, it was the moon
it was the green grass in the garden
the victory and the sin
i know you're weary, look at me
flailing in the corner
here's the towel
go on, throw it in
it was a matter of time
can't you see that it's tearing me up inside?
look what's laying at our feet
that's the wreckage of broken dreams
and burned out halos
and it's here on our street
that place we all run to
it can come down on you
the expectation can be great
if you should ever tire
or if you should require
sudden simple twist of fate
don't hide away, there's something to be said
for pushing through
we'd never ride on horses that discourage you
if you should fall upon hard times
if you should lose your way
there is a place here in this house
that you can stay
if you should find romance
go on and take that chance
before the strategies begin
deadlines and commitments
every morning, in the evening
they can suck you in
boy, don’t i know it
this offer will be standing
all you got to do is call
don't be afraid to knock on the door
if you should fall upon hard times
if you should lose your way
there is a place here in this house
that you can stay
i'm not talking about deadlines and commitments
sold out of confusion
there is a place here in this house that you can stay
i'll catch you darling
i'll be waiting up and on your side
this offer will be standing
all you got to do is call
don't be afraid to knock on the door
if you should fall upon hard times
if you should lose your way
there is a place here in this house
that you can stay
i'm not talking about deadlines and commitments
sold out of confusion
there is a place here in this house that you can stay
i'll catch you darling
i'll be waiting up and on your side (i'm on your side)
i'll catch you darling
i'll be waiting up and on your side
have all the songs been written?
have all the truths been told?
has all the gas been siphoned?
do the banks still carry gold?
has every ship gone sailing?
has every heart gone blue?
have all the songs been written?
oh, i just need one to get through to you
i just need one more
have all the songs been written?
have all your needs been met?
have all these years been worth it
or am i the great regret?
has every ship gone sailing?
has every heart gone blue?
have all the songs been written?
oh, i just need one to get through to you
i just need one more to get through to you
i can't take back what i've done wrong
i just need one more
when the train returns to the rails
when the ship is back in the harbor
i will make you happy again
i can see it, i believe it
i just need one more to get through to you
i just need one more to get through to you
i can't take back what i've done wrong
i just need one more
shaking like the devil when she lets me go
got a new place, and how it's so much better
falling over myself, the television's on
i turn it off and smile
"oh jennifer, you know i always tried
before you say goodbye
leave the bourbon on the shelf
and i'll drink it by myself
and i love you endlessly
darling don't you see i'm not satisfied
until i hold you tight
give me one more chance tonight
and i swear i'll make it right
but you haven't got time for this
and that wrecking bell is ringing
and i'm not satisfied
until i hold you
jennifer, tell me where i stand
and who's that boy holding your hand?
oh, jennifer, you know i always tried
before you say goodbye
leave the bourbon on the shelf
and i'll drink it by myself
and i never liked your hair
or those people that you lie with
but i'm not satisfied until i hold you tight
and i love you endlessly
darling don't you see?
i can't be satisfied until i hold you tight
looking out my window an angel in robe appeared and nearly pulled me apart
a million miles of freedom
a million miles of road
but i still don’t know where to start
she wrote her number down
she gave it to me
they had to scrape me off the floor
in this transient town
waiters and dealers trying to get their foot in the door
that night i called her, she said
daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life
i've been trying to find my place in the world
(i said to her)
baby, baby, babe i got all night
to listen to the heart of a girl
i can see the time dripping down the clock
we've been trying to hear that ancient refrain
it's the one that knows us when our heads are down
it reminds us of the place from where we came
where we came
daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life
i've been trying to find my place in the world
(i said to her)
baby, baby, babe i got all night
to listen to the heart of a girl
what happened here? what is this world?
it's too far from the heart of a girl
a ripple in the water from the drop of a pearl
i'm on the shore waiting for the heart of a girl
many doors
knock on one
standing still, time is raging
staring down the mouth of 100,000 guns
you're still here, you're still here
i believe that we never have to be alone
yes i believe it's just around the bend
you can hold it in, or you can scream it on the microphone
there is no end
there is no end
deep in the night, i feel a presence
of something that was long ago, told to me
there is a hand guiding the river
the river to wide open sea
and deep in my heart, in any game
on any mountain, no i'm not afraid
standing on stone, you stand beside me
and honor the plans that were made
there's gonna be opposition, ain't no way around it
if you're looking for strong and steady, well baby, you found it
we'll weather the coldest nights
baby, we're a dying breed
when everyone's compromising
i'll be your die-hard
i'll be there when water's rising
i'll be your lifeguard
we're cut from a stained glass mountain
baby, we're a dying breed
na-na-na-na-na-na
na-na-na-na-na-na
na-na-na-na-na-na
na-na-na-na-na-na-na
when facing the wind out with you
we rallied and raised up
so now when she comes back kickin'
we'll know what we're made of
there's gonna be opposition
we got everything we need
ooh baby we're a dying breed
from the coveted touch of a girl in love
i was lifted by the sound of a spirit in need
baby, we're a dying breed
i don't know what you want from me
sometimes i don't know what to do
it's like i'm screaming in a dream
it's like i can't get through
what if we're not prepared for this
what if we just can't find the trail
and i remember the promise i made
and the way that i felt
from the coveted touch of a girl in love
i was taken by the sound of a spirit in need
baby, we're a dying breed
we got everything we need
baby, we're a dying breed
glamorous indie rock and roll is what i want
it's in my soul, it's what i need
indie rock and roll, it's time

it's indie rock and roll for me
it's indie rock and roll for me
it's all i need
it's indie rock and roll for me
in a clutch, i'm talking every word for all the boys
electric girls with worn-down toys
make it up, break it up, what do you care?
oh, what do you care?
i take my twist with a shout
a coffee shop with a cause, then i'll freak you out
no sex, no drugs, no life, no love
when it comes to today
stay if you want to love me, stay
oh, don't be shy, let's cause a scene
like lovers do on silver screens
let's make it, yeah, we'll cause a scene

make it up, break it up, what do you care?
it's indie rock and roll for me
aggressively we all defend the role we play
regrettably time’s come to send you on your way
we’ve seen it all bonfires of trust flash floods of pain
it doesn’t really matter don’t you worry it’ll all work out
no it doesn’t even matter don’t you worry what it’s all about
we hope you enjoyed your stay
it’s good to have you with us, even if it’s just for the day
we hope you enjoyed your stay
outside the sun is shining, seems like heaven ain’t far away
it’s good to have you with us
even if it’s just for the day
it’s good to have you with us even if it’s just for the day
outside the sun is shining, seems like heaven ain’t far away
it’s good to have you with us even if it’s just for the day
outside the sun is shining, seems like heaven ain’t far away
a love struck romeo, sings the streets of serenade
laying everybody low with a love song that he made
find a streetlight, steps out of the shade
says something like, "you and me, babe, how about it?"
juliet says, "hey, it's romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"
he's underneath the window, she's singing
hey, la, my boyfriend's back"
you shouldn't come around here, singing up at people like that
anyway what you going to do about it?
juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
and i bet and you exploded in my heart
and i forget, i forget the movie song
when you going to realize, it was just that the time was wrong, juliet?
come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
and i dream your dream for you and now your dream is real
how can you look at me, as if i was just another one of your deals?
well, you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
you can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
you promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin
now you just say, "oh, romeo, yeah, you know
i used to have a scene with him"
juliet, when we made love you use to cry
i said "i love you like the stars above, i love you till i die"
and there's a place for us, you know that movie song
when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, juliet
i can't do the talk like the talk on the tv
and i can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
i can't do everything but i'd do anything for you
can't do anything except be in love with you
and all i do is miss you and the way we used to be
all i do is keep the beat, the bad company
and all i do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
juliet, i'd do the stars with you any time
juliet, when we made love you use to cry
i said "i love you like the stars above, i love you till i die"
and there's a place for us, you know that movie song
when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, juliet
juliet says, "hey, it's romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"
he's underneath the window, she's singing
hey, la, my boyfriend's back"
you shouldn't come around here, singing up at people like that
anyway what you going to do about it?
i've gone through life
white-knuckled in the moments that left me behind
refusing to heed the yield
i penetrate the force fields in the blind
they say i'll adjust
god knows i must
but i'm not sure how
this natural selection picked me out to be
a dark horse running in a fantasy
flesh and bone
am i running out of time?
flesh and bone
somewhere outside that finish line
i square up and break through the chains
and i head like a raging bull
anointed by the blood, i take the reins
cut from the cloth, of a flag that
bears the name of "battle born"
they call me the contender
listen for the bell
my face flashing crimson from the fires of hell
what are you afraid of?
and what are you made of?
flesh and bone
and i'm running out of time
flesh and bone
and what are you made of?
flesh and bone
man i'm turning on a dime
flesh and bone
this could decay
like the valley below
defenses are down
the stakes are high
(scouting the crowd for a face of compassion)
the fairytale end
(to face off the journey that fathers no more)
the staggering blow
(you'll find the truth in the roots of desire)
you lead with your chin
(thinkin' with your corners, just a compass and the sun)
this could be real
(thinkin' with your corners, just a)
simple
and what are you made of?
(flesh and bone)
and i'm running out of time
(flesh and bone)
what are you made of?
he faces forward
trading in his blindness for the glow of love
and time is raging, may it rage in vain
and you always had it, but you never knew
so boots and saddles, get on your feet
there's no surrender, cause there's no retreat
the bells are sobbing, in this monster land
we are the descendants of giant men
get your hair cut
get your money on straight
get your head right
and don't forget where you come from
who your friends are and all that shit
ever since i could hear
a voice of warning
stories of pain and fear ringing in my eardrum
and ever since i could run
there's been somebody with a loaded gun
get your finger on the trigger son
ringin' in my eardrum
get your hair cut
get your money on straight
get your head right
and don't forget where you come from
who your friends are and all that shit
ever since i could hear
a voice of warning
stories of pain and fear ringing in my eardrum
and ever since i could run
there's been somebody with a loaded gun
get your finger on the trigger son
ringin' in my eardrum
get your hair cut
get your money on straight
get your head right
and don't forget where you come from
who your friends are and all that shit
i admit i don't understand how this all started
but i know it's gotten out of hand
we can't go back now
can't just tell ourselves all of this will pass
not while we're
sailin' too close, sailin' too close to the wind
sailin' too close, sailin' too close to the wind
candy talks to strangers
thinks her life's in danger
no one gives a damn about her hair
it's lonely down on track street
she used to go by jackie
the cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers
take a number where the blood just barely dried
wait for something better
no one behind you
watching your shadows
this feeling won't go
crooked wheels keep turning
children, are you learning
acclimatized, but don't you lose the plot
a history of blisters
your brothers and your sisters
somewhere in the pages we forgot
take a number jackie
where the blood just barely dried
you know i'm on your side
wait for something better
no one behind you
watching your shadows
you got to be stronger than the story
don't let it blind you
rivers are shallow
this feeling won't go
your sky is full of dreams
but you don't know how to fly
i don't have a simple answer
but i know that i could answer
something better
this feeling won't go
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
let me wrap myself around you
let you show me how i see
and when you come back in from nowhere
do you ever think of me?
your heart is not able
let me show you how much i care
i need those eyes to tide me over
i’ll take your picture when i go
it gives me strength and gives me patience
but i’ll never let you know
i got nothing on you baby
but i always said i try
let me show you how much i care
'cause sometimes it gets hard
and don’t she know
don’t give the ghost up just clench your fist
you should have known by now you were on my list
don’t give the ghost up just clench your fist
you should have known by now you were on my list
don’t give the ghost up just clench your fist
you should have known by now you were wrong (on my list)
when your heart is not able
and your prayers they’re not fables
let me show you (let me show you)
let me show you (let me show you)
let me show you how much i care oh
the unknown distance to the great beyond
stares back at my grieving frame
to cast my shadow by the holy sun
my spirit moans with a sacred pain
and it's quiet now
the universe is standing still
there's nothing i can say
there's nothing we can do now
there's nothing i can say
there's nothing we can do now
and all that stands between the souls release
this temporary flesh and bone
we know that it's over now
i feel my faded mind begin to roam
every time you fall
and every time you try
every foolish dream
and every compromise
every word you spoke
and everything you said
everything you left me, rambles in my head
there's nothing i can say
there's nothing we can do now
there's nothing i can say
there's nothing we can do now
up above the world so high
and everything you loved
and every time you try
everybody's watching
everybody cry
stay, don't leave me
the stars can wait for your sign
don't signal now
there's nothing i can say
there's nothing we can do now
there's nothing i can say
there's nothing we can do now
goodnight, travel well
goodnight, travel well
and there's nothing i can say
there's nothing i can do now
goodnight, travel well
travel well, travel well
there's a plane and i am flying
there's a mountain waiting for me
oh these years have been so trying
i don't know if i can use them
am i strong enough
to be the one?
(am i strong enough to be the one?)
will i live to have some children?
(children...)
help me get down
i can make it
help me get down
help me get down
i can make it
help me get down
if i only knew the answer
i wouldn't be bothering you, father
help me get down
i can make it
help me get down
help me get down
i can make it
help me get down
if i only knew the answer
and if all our days are numbered
then why do i keep counting?
my sugar sweet is so attainable
this behavior so unexplainable
the days just slip and slide
like they always did
the trouble is my head
won't let me forget
i took one last good look around
so many unusual sounds
i gotta get my feet on the ground
help me get down
i can make it (oh)
help me get down
i can make it, help me get down
help me get down
i can make it, help me get down
if i only knew the answer...
i wouldn't be bothering you, father
help me get down
i can make it, help me get down
help me get down
i can make it, help me get down
if i only knew the answer
and if all our days are numbered
would you help me get down? (i can make it, help me get down)
(help me get down)
(i can make it, help me get down)
if i only knew the answer
if i change my way of living
and if i pave my streets with good times
will the mountain keep on giving?
and if all of our days are numbered
then why do i keep counting?
lift me up on my honor, take me over this spell
get this weight off my shoulders, i've carried it well
loose these shackles of pressure, shake me out of these chains
lead me not to temptation
hold my hand harder, ease my mind
roll down the smoke screen and open the sky
let me fly
man, i need a release from this troublesome mind
fix my feet when they’re stumbling
and well, you know it hurts sometimes
you know it's going to bleed sometimes
dig me out from this thorn tree, help me bury my shame
keep my eyes from the fire, they can’t handle the flame
grace cut out from my brothers when most of them fell
i carry it well
let me fly
man, i need a release from this troublesome mind
fix my feet when they’re stumbling
i guess you know it hurts sometimes
you know it's going to bleed sometimes
now hold on
i’m not looking for sweet talk, i’m looking for time
top a tower and sleepwalk, brother, 'cause it hurts sometimes
you know it's going to bleed sometimes
hold on
you know it's going to hurt sometimes
when you call me, hold on
hold on
hold on
i’m going to climb that symphony home and make it mine
let his resonance light my way
see, all these pessimistic sufferers tend to drag me down
so i could use it to shelter what good i’ve found
the emotion it was electric
and the stars, they all aligned
i knew i had to make my decision
but i never made the time
no, i never made the time
in the dark, for a while now
i can't stay, so far
i can't stay much longer
riding my decision home
exoneration lost his eraser
but my forgiver found the sun
and there are twisted days that i take comfort
because i'm not the only one
no, i'm not the only one
in the dark, for a while now
i can't stay, very far
i can't stay much longer
riding my decision home
now there's a majesty at my doorstep
and there's a little boy in her arms
now we'll parade around without game plans
obligation or alarm
in the dark, for a while now
i can't stay, very far
i can't stay much longer
riding my decision home
in the dark, for a while now
i can't stay, so far
i can't stay much longer
riding my decision home
in the dark
time it tells, living in my home town
wedding bells they begin easy
live it down, baby don't talk that much
baby knows, but baby don't tease me
in the park we could go walking
drown in the dark or we could go sailing
on the sea
always here, always on time
close call, was it love or was it just easy
money talks when people need shoes and socks
steady boys, i'm thinking she needs me
i was just sipping on something sweet
i don't need political process
i got this feeling that they're going to break down the door
i got this feeling they they're going to come back for more
see i was thinking that i lost my mind
but it's been getting to me all this time
and it don't stop dragging me down
silently reflection turns my world to stone
patiently correction leaves us all alone
and sometimes i'm a travel man
but tonight this engine's failing
i still hear the children playing
kick the can, kick the can, skip and blackjack
steal a car and ring a round-rosey
rock and roll, candy land, boogeyman
run away and give me your sneakers
acid rain, when abel looked up at cain
we began the weeping and wailing
a hurried high from pestilence, pills and pride
it's a shame, we could've gone sailing
but heaven knows
heaven knows everything
tranquilize
i got this feeling that they're going to break down the door
i got this feeling they they're going to come back for more
see i was thinking that i lost my mind
but it's been getting to me all this time
and it don't stop dragging me down
silently reflection turns my world to stone
patiently correction leaves us all alone
and sometimes i'm a travel man
but tonight this engine's failing
i still hear the children playing
dead beat dancers come to us and stay
'cause i don't care where you've been
and i don't care what you've seen
we're the ones who still believe
and we're looking for a page
in that lifeless book of hope
where a dream might help you cope
with the bushes and the bombs
are, tranquilized
console me in my darkest hour
convince me that the truth is always gray
caress me in your velvet chair
conceal me from the ghost you cast away
i ain't in no hurry
you go run and tell your friends i'm losing touch
fill their heads with rumors of impending doom
it must be true
console me in my darkest hour
and tell me that you always hear my cries
i wonder what you've got conspired
i'm sure it dawns a consolation prize
i ain't in no hurry
you go run and tell your friends i'm losing touch
fill the night with stories, the legend grows
of how you got lost
but you made your way back home
you sold your soul
like a roman vagabond, yeah
i heard you found a wishing well in the city
console me in my darkest hour
then you throw me down
i ain't in no hurry
you go run and tell your friends i'm losing touch
fill your crown with rumors
impending doom, it must be true
but you made your way back home
you sold your soul like a roman vagabond
and about how you got lost
but you made your way back home
you went and sold your soul
an allegiance dead and gone
i'm losing touch

well, no one else around believes me!
but the children on the street they tease me
i couldn't let them off that easy
believe me

that it helps to take away the pain

that it helps to take away the pain
hey, jonny

i said my appetite ain't got no heart
shocking people when you feel that pull

it's a yearning that you can't ignore

when everybody else refrained
my uncle jonny did cocaine
a little birdie whispered in my ear
you've been cooking up a world of fear
put your hands in things you shouldn't have known
he was riding in the danger zone
well you had us all fooled, with your quarterback smile
and your crocodile tears, there for a while
my paradigm shifted and you make me shout
hey, from here on out
friends are going to be hard to come by
left to wonder what it all was about
he had it easy then he chose the hard way
walk that lonely road in a shadow of a doubt
from here on out
should our paths ever decide to cross
you may wonder what the trouble costs
that don't matter now, life goes on
hallelujah, the troubles' gone
no sense in holding purpose and it's better to forgive
these are things that i must learn, to practice while i live
and my paradigm shifted, man you're making me shout
hey, from here from out
friends are gonna be hard to come by
left us wonderin' what it all was about
he had it easy, man he chose the hard way
walk that old, lonely road in the shadow of a doubt
hey, from here on out
let the bugle blow a song of peace time
left us wonderin' what it all was about
you may deny it but you carry it with you
down that old lonely road in the shadow of a doubt
yeah, from here on out
to the center of the city where all roads meet
waiting for you
to the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank
searching for you
well, i was moving through the silence without motion
waiting for you
in a room without a window in the corner
i found truth
in the shadowplay acting out your own death
knowing no more
as the assassins all grouped in four lines
dancing on the floor
and with cold steel, odour on their bodies
made a move to connect
but i could only stare in disbelief
as the crowds all left
woo!
i did everything, everything i wanted to
i let them use you for their own ends
to the center of the city in the night, waiting for you
to the center of the city in the night, waiting for you
woo!
she's got her halo and wings hidden under his eyes
but she's an angel for sure, she just can't stop telling lies
but it's too late for his love, already caught in a trap
his angel's kiss was a joke and she is not coming back
because heaven sends and heaven takes
crashing cars in his brain
keep him tied up to a dream
and only she can set him free
and then he says to me
kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
yeah, she's got a criminal mind, he's got a reason to pray
his life is under the gun, he's got to hold every day
now he just wants to wake up, yeah, just to prove it's a dream
'cause she's an angel for sure, but that remains to be seen
because heaven sends and heaven takes
crashing cars in his brain
keep him tied up to a dream
and only she can set him free
and then he says to me
kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
stupid on the streets of london
james dean in the rain
without her it's not the same
but it's alright
because heaven sends and heaven takes
crashing cars in his brain
and keep him tied up to a dream
and only she can set him free
and then he says to me
kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
again and again
far from the evergreen of old assam
far from the rainfall on the trails of old saigon
straight from the poster town of scorn and ritz

fire in bone

and i felt alone
i felt unknown

(wrongly accused and disowned)
i felt fire in bone
i felt big time
i felt major league
i felt weird sin
i felt fire in bone
i felt ripped off
run down, wrung out
empty, unseen
and preyed upon
i felt fire in bone
i felt fire in bone
when i came back empty-handed
you were waiting in the road
and you fell on my neck
and you took me back home
after all that i took from you
after all that i put you through
here i am
i felt fire in bone
i felt washed up
i felt tempest-tossed and seasick
but i felt fire in bone
i felt mislead
i felt chained up, unclean, unknown
i felt unknown
i felt fire in bone
i felt fire in bone
they say no one's gonna save you
you've gotta make it on your own
but i called from the dark
and you picked up the phone
on my back in the raging blue
i looked up, and you cut right through
and when i came empty-handed
you met me in the road
and you fell on my neck
and you took me back home
after all that i took from you
after all that i put you through
here i am

she's reaching for her backpack
puts out a cigarette and gets on the bus
she's seating on a secret she didn't ask for
no girl ever did
there's a whisper in her heartbeat
she can hear it just enough to keep her alive
but she's breathing in the blowback
there's nothing you can offer she ain't already tried
she's breathing in the blowback
born into poor white trash and always type-cast
but she's gonna break out, boy you better know that
it's just a matter of time
she fights back
breathing in the blowback
she is sucking on a tic-tac
a good man is a mystery, she's looking for clues
whoa, you better check that buddy
'cause the blacktop's burning up what's left of the fuse
she knows where she comes from
doesn't need you dragging her all through it again
it's like breathing in the blowback
it's a highjack, now how much sure are you willing to spend?
she's breathing in the blowback
born into poor white trash and always type-cast
but she's gonna break out, boy you better know that
it's just a matter of time
she fights back
breathing in the blowback
pinwheels spinning, roller skates and red flags
breathing in the blowback
she's gonna break out, boy, you better know that
can you cast out a demon?
can you wrangle the wind?
will you stay when she's breathing the blowback again?
we hope you enjoy your stay
it's good to have you with us
even if it's just for the day
we hope you enjoy your stay
outside the sun is shining
it seems like heaven ain't far away
it's good to have you with us
even if it's just for the day
michael plays with stars

in the night while i try

where everybody talks the same
those blue suede babies

it's getting close to sundown
over the sierra
stranded on the heat wave
burning with desire
she was on the sidewalk
looking for a nightlife
talked about the real thing
and drove into the fire
headlights on the highway
the desert wind is howling
rattlesnakes and romance
are spilling with the rain
candy apple red dress
bleeding when she kissed me
heaven in a rag top
takes away my-my pain
when your chips are down
when your highs are low
joy ride
(joy ride)
move across the night like a separate wind
(joy ride)
pulled up to a motel
vacancy was buzzing
pink and dirty neon
settled on the hood
wrapped her arms around me
come a little closer
stumbled in the twilight
and fell onto the floor of the mona lisa
dreaming of the free world
lipstick on the nightstand
and demons at the door
when your chips are down
when your highs are low
joy ride
(joy ride)
move across the night like a separate wind
(joy ride)
when your hopes and dreams
lose the will to go
joy ride
(joy ride)
reaching for the light
more than we can win
(joy ride)
there's something in the distance
a glorious existence
a simple celebration
a place you never been before
(why don't you kiss me?)
tell me that you want it more
reaching for the light
more than we can win
when your chips are down
(when your chips are down)
when your highs are low
joy ride
(joy ride)
all your hopes and dreams
all you need to know
joy ride
(joy ride)
some time ago, at santa's place
up in the old north pole
there lived a lump of anthracite
whose parents called him joel
joel, joel, the lump of coal
happy as a lump can be
he just wants to keep santa warm
and make the elves cozy
but santa claus had other plans
for joel one fateful day
"joel, you're just the lump i need
come join me on my sleigh"
joel, joel, the lump of coal
heart leapt up with joy
"i'll soon be santa's present to
a lucky girl or boy
we'll laugh and play together
and hold each other tight
snuggle under clean white sheets
when we go to sleep at night"
then santa's elves all laughed at joel
"you're in for a surprise
you're not a special christmas gift
you're just a booby prize
what kid would ever want you?
you're filthy as can be
now you have to go and live
with one who's been naughty"
"but i make heat," poor joel cried
"and electricity"
"you pollute the air
with co2 and mercury"
joel, joel, the lump of coal
fell down upon his knees
"i don't wanna live with a naughty kid
don't make me, santa, please"
but santa laughed his jolly laugh
"ho, ho, you stupid lump
you're just the thing to teach this brat
that santa ain't no chump"
so off they flew and, before he knew
joel was in a sack
he cried and yelled to santa claus
"why don't we just go back?"
and then came christmas morning
and, much to joel's surprise (much to joel's surprise)
he saw a boy with the saddest face
and tears were in his eyes (tears were in his eyes)
he picked joel up and held him
and said "you can be my friend (hey man, let's be friends)
i would've liked some presents but
you're what santa chose to send (santa chose to send)
it's true, i've been a naughty boy
and maybe that's a sin (maybe that's a sin)
if this is how santa treats the kids
i'm just glad that i'm not him"
joel, joel, the lump of coal
knew what he must do
he said "now i know the reason why
i got sent to you
cause when a person hurts inside
it turns him hard and cruel
but i know how to make your pain
into a precious jewel
so take me in your hand, young man
and squeeze with all your might
let's turn your pain and anger
into something that shines bright"
then joel, joel, the lump of coal
he gave his life away
so that one good naughty little boy
had a diamond on christmas day
the streets of persuasion
are plated with gold
your heart's in the right place
but you traveled down the wrong road
like so many before you, the gates open wide
here come the rising tide
let's go out tonight
there's a mystery underneath the neon light
before life and the dream collide
because the truth going to come and cut me open wide
and you can't escape the rising of the tide
keep up your appearance
you're joining the choir
with everybody singing out hallelujah
the time came for your solo
but there was nowhere to hide
here come the rising tide
and the company you keep
where they plan your crucifixion as we speak
so baby, till life and the dream collide
there's going to be a mystery underneath those neon lights
if you can't decipher just who's on your side
you will not escape the rising of the tide
can you tell me brother
was i deceived?
or in denial
i was there in the back of the room when you testified
with your pitchfork tongue you lick your lips and lie
we're never going to know how hard you cry
when you petition and your access was denied
till the venom in your veins is satisfied
till you suffocate and swallow down your pride
where you can't escape, can't escape the rising of the tide
you have one saved message
to listen to your messages, press one
first saved message
message sent yesterday at 10:41pm
ha, i got to tell you
i'll make it better
but i know that's something i needed to say
when i was out, though
maybe you were better alone
i know i'll make it home
she told me sweet thing
run a labour
in your shoes
touch me til i follow in love
i want to help her
maybe we were better alone
i want to show you how
and then we walked out
make it now
i said i want it but i'm never alone
i want to show you
maybe we were something uncool
i want to make you sing
uh uh oh
uh uh oh
uh uh oh
she's a pillar by the day, a fire by night
she's a famous architect, like frank lloyd wright
when it comes to tight rope walking
she's world-renowned
her elegance and charm are worthy of praise
and i heard she used to throw, for the oakland a's
she works 268 hours a week, i've yet to meet her match
a marvel of modern science
she's a natural-born pioneer
i can't make up my mind
should i put her on display, or hide her?
i'm going to be her prize fighter
i know that she's out of my league
i'm going to be her prize fighter
my uniform has been decreed
she's a daughter of the gods, got a lot of clout
if she's ever in a bind, i'll get her out
and sometimes i have these nightmares, in the middle of the day
where a hay-making gypsy just steals her away
there is no doubt about it
(no doubt about it)
i'm a slave to her shade of love
(no doubt about it)
one day her majesty the queen, unprovoked and unforeseen
she's going to fly her over to england, put that sword on her shoulder, and knight her
i'm going to be her prize fighter
no label's going to change where she's from
i'm going to be her prize fighter
and i'm dancing to the beat of her drum
she's always on my side, rich or poor
she's with me all the way, to the golden door
my lioness, my pièce de résistance
my only way
i'm going to drive me an el dorado
the color of her monterey eyes
with twin bullet tail lights
and plates that read desire
i'm going to be her prize fighter
though the weather may be foul
i'm going to be her prize fighter
though the wind and the wolves may howl
 
through the sunshine and through the rain
i'm going to be her prize fighter
over and over again
let me out
don’t tell me everything
started out like any other day
must have gave the wrong impression
don’t you understand where i belong?
i’m not the one
stand again
they say nothing comes for free
and that’s the truth, i’ve been living in a fantasy
slip and slide
a head trip heaven
self-denial such a wonderful and powerful thing
well i’m not the one
the morning dove sings with two broken wings
carry me home
i’m not afraid
the stars in my eyes were shimmering lights
carry me home
don’t let me fade away
stop the press
the kid’s light is growing dim
i took a month long slide
then the world came caving in
when you self-destruct
you wind up looking for a glimmer of hope
but the writing’s on the wall
i’m not the one
the morning dove sings with two broken wings
carry me home
i’m not afraid
the stars in my eyes were shimmering lights
carry me home
don’t let me fade away
just how thick is your skin?
just how sharp are your teeth?
ohh, you’ve got a lot to learn
is there somewhere else i can win?
is there something else to start over again?
from the summit's edge, to the cutting room floor
i will be afraid no more (no more)
the morning dove sings with two broken wings
carry me home
i’m not afraid
the stars in my eyes were shimmering lights
carry me home
don’t let me fade
carry me home
carry me
take me to the place where the white boys dance
take me to the place where they run and play
my baby is gone, you might have a chance
just take me to the place where the white boys dance
they hug in silence
as the sun sets
on their empty street
her suspicions well they risin' high
and the man who sweeps him off she doesn't meet
she walks inside
pours a strong one
put her mind at ease
it's the calm before another storm
and the brain shifts from the whiskey to the keys
take me to the place where the white boys dance
take me to the place where they run and play
my baby is gone, you might have a chance
just take me to the place where the white boys dance
her heart is racing
she phones a friend and says
"i'm in an awful place
that fool’s been messin' round on me
i've seen it in his eyes and on his face"
hold on a minute
you're talking crazy
don't be that jealous girl
just tell le'von you need an hour or two
cause we're gonna go and change somebody's world
take me to the place where the white boys dance
take me to the place where they run and play
my baby is gone, you might have a chance
just take me to the place where the white boys dance
it's the calm before another storm
it's the calm before another storm
and her brain shifts from the whiskey to the keys
take me to the place where the white boys dance
take me to the place where they run and play
my baby is gone, you might have a chance
just take me to the place where the white boys dance
i'll tell you what you wanna know
but boy you better listen close
people gonna tell you lies
don't let it come as a surprise
that woman's on my back again
i know she's got the best intentions
when you begin to realize
you know you got your daddy's eyes
and there's something that i want to say
i love her, too
and all of this has got nothing to do with you
and i'd like to stay but i can't because
i've been fooling around and i know
that you called because you never even knew
that it was hurting me
when you put it on the other hand
when you're old enough to understand
that glove will bring it all to life
i didn't say that made it right
that woman's on my back again
i know she's got the best intentions
when you begin to realize
you know you got your daddy's eyes
that woman's on my back again
i know she's got the best intentions
when you begin to realize
you know you got your daddy's eyes
and sometimes people get tired
and i woke up a little too late to lie
dreams should last a long time
this is not what i'd call goodbye
that woman's on my back again
i know she's got the best intentions
when you begin to realize
you know you got your daddy's eyes
that woman's on my back again
i know she's got the best intentions
when you begin to realize
you know you got your daddy's eyes
i love her, too
woke up to sun streaming in my room
warm beachfront palm december afternoon
you close your eyes
another year blows by
somewhere in the wind
just another life
my parents sent a christmas card and tennis shoes
"we understand you’re staying
and we’re proud of you"
there’s a well-rehearsed disinterest in the atmosphere
i don’t know if that’s what this town gave me
or if it led me here
and i played so many parts
i don’t know which one’s really me
don’t know if i can take
another christmas in l.a
another pitcher of sangria
in an empty beach café
another christmas in l.a
hold me tighter carmelita
i don’t know how long i can stay
left a girl behind in my old man’s truck
sometimes i wonder where she ended up
maybe she got married, had a couple of kids
who do you think you’re fooling man?
of course she did
i’m walking in dan tana's bar
try and talk with harry dean
i don’t know if i can take
another christmas in l.a
another casting call on thursday
for a job that doesn’t pay
another christmas in l.a
another burnout in a tank top
who seems to bask in his decay
a fat protagonist in flip flops
with an extensive resume
from echo park to catalina
dreaming of a white christmas
the one i used to know
tree tops glisten, children listen
to sleigh bells in the snow
oh, god, oh, god
dear father in heaven
i'm not a praying man but if you're up there and you can hear me
show me the way
i'm at the end of my road and i...
show me the way, oh god
no more trouble in this town
silent night for a change
a brand new year coming up ahead
you know it's been so long since i rang one in
i close my eyes, think about the path i took
just when i think these times have gotten the best of me
i can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the floor
watching television, it's a wonderful life
cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
smile below each nose and above each chin
stomp my boots before i go back in
i wasted my wishes on saturday nights
boy, what i would give for just one more
i'd soften my heart, shock the world
do you hear my voice?
do you know my name?
light my way, lift my head, light my way
i can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the floor
watching television, it's a wonderful life
cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
smile below each nose and above each chin
stomp my boots before i go back in
family all together, presents piled high
frost on all the windows, what a wonderful night
cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
smile below each nose and above each chin
so happy they found me
love was all around me
stomp my boots before i go back in
dear santa
i'm writing you a letter
i'm sure you've got it all figured out
things haven't been easy between me and you
i guess that there are things that you can't undo
maybe i was naughty once but now i'm nice
boy you made the list
you know i checked it twice
well guess what
you're still on it!
hahaha!
and i feel it in my bones (yeah, yeah)
and i feel it in my bones
(ho ho ho)
(ho ho ho)
(ho ho ho)
nights have been restless, pillows and sheets

i sweat like a snowman out in the sun
dreaming that there ain't nowhere to run to, baby
nowhere to hide
hey, kringle!
you mean to say when you were young, you never got wild?
kid, don't you get it?
i'm gonna make an example out of you
for every mother's child
and i feel it in my bones (i'm coming for you)
and i feel it in my bones
silver bells and reigns
tinsel, holly
what happened to the rose red cheeks
chimney, big bag presents and all
fat and jolly
tinsel holly

merry christmas
in the borough of brent
the legend is real
stands a two headed monster
made of 33,000 tons of steel
and they called it wembley
whether it's a hot blooded win, or heartbreaking loss
those three lions proudly play under the weight of st. george's cross
out in wembley
day-oh

mr. brightside had you scratching your head
when you heard we were from vegas
but you were positive it was sheffield or camden
but that didn't matter
the seed was planted
you took us in like your own
now we're bound by tradition
my, how we've grown
from dave's apartment to wembley
sing it:
i got soul but i'm not a soldier
(i got soul but i'm not a soldier)
da da da da da
(da da da da da)
and the decades disappear like a sinking ship
but we persevere, god gives us hope
but we still fear what we don't know
the devil's water and the good old days
ain't we all just runaways?

here in my house, time is sweet
i hear the children playing in the street
out where the hot winds blowing in the breeze
i don't need time, i don't need time
no, i can get by myself
i don't need time, i don't know why
the summer wind did not tell
i scramble on line and i know that i
will never be calm and well
but i can get by in the meantime by myself
he's a real winner, all over they say
sleeping in the lazy afternoon
a danger to their daughters they assume
i don't need time, i don't need time
no, i can get by myself
i don't need time, i don't know why
the summer wind did not tell
i scramble on line and i know that i
will never be calm and well
but i can get by in the meantime by myself
deal me a crippling blow
steal me from under my clothes
a crippling blow
i don't need time, i don't need time
no, i can get by myself
i don't need time, i don't know why
the summer wind did not tell
i scramble on line and i know that i
will never be calm and well
but i can get by in the meantime by myself
lord i can get by in the meantime by myself
i can get by in the meantime by myself
we used to tear it down
but now we just exist
the things that i did wrong
i'll bet you've got a list
now i know how you remember
and those moments that you choose
will define me as a traitor
stealing everything you lose
forget about what i said
the lights are gone and the parties over
forget about what i said
forget about what i said
i'm older now and i know you hear me
forget about what i said
you'll stay up late tonight
you'll turn off your phone
well you were selfish too
but you were never all alone
in those ugly pink apartments
with the hustlers and the kids
mapping out some retribution
do we have to go through this?
forget about what i said
the lights are gone and the parties over
forget about what i said
forget about what i said
i'm older now and i know you hear me
forget about what i said
all of the stars are wandering around tonight
we used to try them on
and sometimes i hear you
the galaxy sings your song
and tonight i sing along
forget about what i said
the lights are gone and the parties over
forget about what i said
forget about what i said
i'm older now and i know you hear me
forget about what i said
last time i said i was in control
i had twenty-five debts and we both know
when you come back now
you'll see my face
i said twenty-five debts and we both pray
while i move away
hard times don't come until tomorrow
these eyes don't see
take your skin off when you listen to me
move away
hard times don't come until tomorrow
these eyes in me
take your skin off when you're talking to me
me
oh what a world that we both come in
i said hold it to the rock and let it in
oh what a world that we are in
i said hold it to the rock and we're both in
while i move away
hard times don't come until tomorrow
these eyes don't see
take your skin off when you listen to me
move away
hard times don't come until tomorrow
these eyes in me
take your skin off when you're talking to me
me
don't worry about what might have been
just tell your woman that you're sorry
and you jumped out of your skin
listen closely to your motto
don't worry about what might have been
tell the jury that you're sorry
and just jump out of your skin
i want to jump out of my skin
i want to jump out of my skin
and watch the clouds
move away
i'm never gonna live it down
move away
move away
move move move move away
move away
move away
hard times don't come until tomorrow
these eyes don't see
take your skin off when you listen to me
move away
hard times don't come until tomorrow
move away
move away
move away
move away
you've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
the shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
oh ruby, don't take your love to town
it wasn't me that started this old crazy asian war
but i was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
and yes, it's true that i'm not the man i used to be
oh ruby, i still need some company
it's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
and the wants and needs of a woman your age ruby i realize
but it won't be long, i've heard them say, until i'm not around
oh ruby, don't take your love to town
she's leaving now cause i just heard the slamming of the door
the way i know i've heard it slam one hundred times before
and if i could move i'd get my gun and put her in the ground
oh ruby, don't take your love to town
oh ruby, for god's sake, turn around
he’s always trouble with his non complacent
shotgun eyes, shotgun eyes
his subtlety, his mystery
not like the other guys
she’s always taken by his reputation
he’s so bad, he’s so bad
on saturday night, they’re running for the shadow
you say your heart is not ever been broken
you think you know where you’re going
tidal wave
tidal wave come rushing over me
you say this life has given you nothing
you got another thing coming
tidal wave
tidal wave come rushing over me
he’ll get a warning sign to keep his distance
from her old man, from her old man
now the story of forbidden love
has got to make a stand
so in the middle of the early morning
they’ll slip away, slip away
and we know they’ll do their best
somewhere in the golden west
oh yeah, and we’ll watch them drive
they’re so alive
these tidal waves are caught off track
come tomorrow, because i can’t go back
come together, can’t you see
tidal wave going to cover me
these tidal waves are caught off track
come tomorrow, because i can’t go back
come together, can’t you see
tidal wave going to cover me
cover me
i can’t go back
can’t you see
your class, your caste, your country, sect, your name or your tribe
there's people always dying trying to keep 'em alive
there's bodies decomposing in containers tonight
in an abandoned building where
squatters made a mural of a mexican girl
with fifteen cans of spray paint and a chemical swirl
she's standing in the ashes at the end of the world
four winds blowing through her hair
but when great satan's gone, the whore of babylon
she just can't sustain the pressure where it's placed
she caves, she caves
the bible's blind, the torah's deaf, the qur'ans mute
if you burned them all together you'd get close to the truth still
they're pouring over sanskrit on the ivy league moons
while shadows lengthen in the sun
cast all the school and meditation built to soften the times
and hold us at the center while the spiral unwinds
it's knocking over fences crossing property lines
four winds, cry 'til it comes
and it's the son of man, slouching towards bethlehem
a heart just can't contain all of that empty space
it breaks. it breaks. it breaks!
well i went back by rented cadillac and company jet
like a newly orphaned refugee retracing my steps
all the way to cassadaga to commune with the dead
they said, "you'd better look alive"
and i was off to old dakota where a genocide sleeps
in the black hills, the badlands, the calloused east
i buried my ballast. i made my peace
with four winds leveling the pines
but when great satan's gone, the whore of babylon
she just can't remain with all that outer space
she breaks. she breaks. she caves. she caves
she breaks
you better look alive
hey kid
i'm getting tired
of all this
running around
i think i'm going down
oh yeah
don't you think it's time
time we reconciled
maybe we could
talk a while
santa had a change of heart
santa had a change of heart
santa had a change of heart
santa had a change of heart
a change of heart
a change of heart
and we know it wasn't easy
you've been after me a long while
a pathological display
now take a moment to imagine
my dismay
when i heard you had a heart change
i was sceptical at first
til you've seen it for yourself
i guess you just expect the worst
crooked nose and bloodshot eyes
iron will for telling lies
cheap sick smile and one inch fuse
you hurt me santa and i'm confused
pretty girls, christmas lights
mistletoe, holy nights
don't it sound like heaven on a cloud
yeah, i hear you on the bomb shell
i was taken back myself
and i'd like to make it alright
so i called the elves
we hashed up a little guess what
your nice status was renewed
just tell santa what you want
i'm gonna make your dreams come true
red porsche 944 like jake
in "sixteen candles" for goodness sake
and a couple more you might have missed
like a shiny rolex on my wrist and
pretty girls, christmas lights
mistletoe, holy nights
don't it sound like heaven on a cloud
too many people in black robes posing as judges
they should turn that mirror around
too many people weighed down by frivolous grudges
when will we look to leave the past behind
you know it's nice to see you wrapped up
see how far you've come
there's something to be said for being present
not just getting one
so pass the gravy and tap your toes
and don't mind ol' jack frost nipping at your nose
crooked nose and bloodshot eyes
iron will for telling lies
if you've got squabble in your skin
just take that turkey and trade it in for
pretty girls, christmas lights
mistletoe, holy nights
all i ever really wanted was
pretty girls, christmas lights
mistletoe, holy nights
don't it sound like heaven on a cloud
don't it sound like heaven on a cloud
who let you go? who let you go?
who let you go? who let you go?
who let you go? who let you go?
who let you go? who let you go?
i feel it inside, down in my soul
and i just can't hide these things that i know
we could be friends
and i promise that it won't get bad
but hopefully that story ends
but you ain't got nothing i never had
so let's take it slow
who let you go? who let you go?
who let you go? who let you go?
someone must have loved you
not the way that i do
you're missing what i'm trying to say
ain't nothing getting in my way
so tell me that's fantastic
and promise me, you'll always sigh
i find it so romantic
when you look into my beautiful eyes
and lose control
who let you go? who let you go?
who let you go? who let you go?
who let you go? who let you go?
who let you go? who let you go?
i feel it inside, down in my soul
and i just can't hide these things that i know
i don't know what it means
but i've been wondering
who let you go?
and honey, when you walk my way
it makes me wanna say
ohhh
sha-la-la-lo, sha-la-la-lo
sha-la-la-lo, sha-la-la-lo
this snowman is shaping up to be an 8
but not out of 10
the robots awake to find that they've been taped down
wondering when they'll break through these chains
but little boys have action toys for brains
i'm living proof it can last a long time
now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet
when they're all in bed
they got their make-up and dreams of wonderland
sprinkled inside their heads
and soon they will change
but tonight hollywood has never seemed so strange
now mother's pray it'll last a long time
i want to roll around like a kid in the snow
i want to re-learn what i already know
just let me take flight
dressed in red, through the night
on a great big sled
i want to wish you merry christmas
ho ho ho
now they boys are all grown up
and their working their fingers to the bone
they go around chasing them girls on the weekend
you know they still can't be alone
i've been racking my brain
with thoughts of peace and love
how on earth did we get so mixed up?
i pray to god it don't last a long time
i want to roll around like a kid in the snow
i want to re-learn what i already know
just let me take flight
dressed in red, through the night
on a great big sled
i hear the sound of bells
there's something on the roof
i wonder what this night will bring
i want to roll around like a kid in the snow
i want to re-learn what i already know
just let me take flight
dressed in red, through the night
on a great big sled
i want to wish you merry christmas
(can't do that)
i want to wish you merry christmas
(can't do that)
well i woke up christmas morning and what did i see?
i saw a lovely señorita looking back at me
named guadalupe with big brown eyes
boy what did you do this time?
made my excuses and a beeline for the bedroom door
she was begging and a-pleading screaming "por favor
mi cumpleaños stay with me
baby it's cold outside"
we are living in a difficult time
we've been walking down a difficult line
put your feet up baby it's christmas time
cumpleanos feliz
happy birthday guadalupe
(our time will come)
(we both hold on)
she gave me coffee and tortillas to console my head
prepared the slippers on my feet before she made our bed
and blew the candles from her favorite cake
and we kissed beneath the mistletoe
i pulled her body close to mine and i had just one chance
i whispered "baby will you marry me for just one dance?"
infatuation the things you say
i got scared and i left that night
we are living in a difficult time
we've been walking down a difficult line
put your feet up baby it's christmas time
cumpleanos feliz
happy birthday guadalupe
(our time will come)
(we both hold on)
deck the halls with rosaries
wish upon a christmas tree
silent night please come to me
bearing gifts from my... my mexican angel
at night i wake up cold and lonely busting at the seams
she haunts the early morning hours of december dreams
my guadalupe with big brown eyes
i wanna break the spell tonight
we are living in a difficult time
we've been walking down a difficult line
put your feet up baby it's christmas time
cumpleanos feliz
happy birthday guadalupe
(our time will come)
(we both hold on)
happy birthday guadalupe
way out in the land of the setting sun
where the wind blows wild and free
there's a lovely spot, just the only one
that means home sweet home to me
if you follow the old kit carson trail
until the desert meets the hills
oh you certainly will agree with me it's the place of a thousand thrills
home means nevada, home means the hills
home means the sage and the pine
out by the truckee silvery rills
out where the sun always shines
here is the land that i love the best
fairer than all i can see
she's deep in the heart of the golden west
home mean nevada to me
 
well your eyes just haven't been the same, joseph
are you bad at dealing with the fame, joseph
there's a pale moonshine, above you
do you see both sides, do they shove you, around
is the touchstone forcing you to hide, joseph
are the rumors eating you alive, joseph
when the holy night is upon you
will you do what's right, the position is yours
 
from the temple walls to the new york night
our decisions rest on a child
when she took her stand
did she hold your hand
will your faith stand still or run away
run away
 
when they've driven you so far
that you think you're going to drop
do you wish you were back there at the carpenter shop
 
with the plane and the lathe
the work never drove you mad
you're a maker, a creator
not just somebody's dad
from the temple walls to the new york night
our decisions rest on a man
when i take the stand
when i take the stand
will he hold my hand
will my faith stand still or run away
(run away)
 
and the desert
it's a hell of a place to find heaven
forty years lost in the wilderness looking for god
and you climb to the top of the mountain
looking down on the city
where you were born
(on the years since you left gave you time to sit back and reflect)
better you than me (better you than me)
better you than me
yes
well the holy night is upon you (better you than me)
do you see both sides, do they shove you, around
better you than me, joseph (better you than me)
better you than me
joseph, joseph, joseph, joseph
than me
better you than me
better you than me (better you, better you, better you)
than me
well your eyes just haven't been the same, joseph
now i know
"spanish harlem" are not just pretty words to say
i thought i knew
but now i know that rose trees never grow
in new york city
until you've seen this trash can dream come true
you stand at the edge while people run you through
and i thank the lord
there's people out there like you
i thank the lord there's people out there like you
while mona lisas and mad hatters
sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
turn around and say good morning to the night
for unless they see the sky
but they can't and that is why
they know not if it's dark outside or light
this broadway's got
it's got a lot of songs to sing
if i knew the tunes, i might join in
i go my way alone
grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in new york city
subway's no way for a good man to go down
rich man can ride and the hobo he can drown
and i thank the lord for the people i have found
i thank the lord for the people i have found
while mona lisas and mad hatters
sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
turn around and say good morning to the night
for unless they see the sky
but they can't and that is why
they know not if it's dark outside or light
and now i know
"spanish harlem" are not just pretty words to say
i thought i knew
but now i know that rose trees never grow
in new york city
subway's no way for a good man to go down
rich man can ride and the hobo he can drown
and i thank the lord for the people i have found
i thank the lord for the people that i have found
while mona lisas and mad hatters
sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
turn around and say good morning to the night
for unless they see the sky
but they can't and that is why
they know not if it's dark outside or light
they know not if it's dark outside or light
lyrics from snippet
 of night
i walked away the pain
and all the times i called it love
was just a matter of getting to you
infatuation fades
and champagne dreams go flat
 man and woman enough
 is more than that
 must be crazy to shout it
 there ain't no doubt about it
 man and woman enough
the  is in your eyes
i saw the future
when you spoke your mind
words of paradise
 i'll have  if you
"my mother and father spent most of their lives in henderson, nevada. the small, dusty sidecar of las vegas. henderson was just like any other town in america, only with slot machines in the laundromat. it was 1990, and vegas was boomin', baby! but jeanie and terry weren't gamblers or dealers or mafiosos or lounge singers. they were just two normal people trying to keep up with the pack in a one-hundred-and-sixteen-degree rat race. and those rats; they'd nibbled long enough. now, i don't know what a mosey looks like, but they packed up their house and their clothes and their me, and they moseyed on outta dodge. of course, i had my gripes about leavin'. i mean, i had a life in henderson. kenny and kevin hebner were just two houses up. the desert fort behind my house wasn't gonna defend itself. but what could i do? i was nine. a nine-year-old can't just stage a sit-in while the rest of the family checks out. this wasn't a home alone movie, so... i went where the sweet'n'sour chicken was cooked, and the ice cold, caffeine-free coke was just a fridge away. and just like that, from sagebrush, slot machines and elvis to footloose, onion days and jewel. she was born there, after all. this place called payson, utah. god's country. population: blink, and you'll miss it. dad got a job in the produce department at the smith's food king, which was fitting since he managed to produce six kids: april, shelley, amy, stephanie and my brother shane were the other five. i was in fourth grade at the time, an age when boys start thinking more like men. and there wasn't a dull moment: i'd had my first fight, my first crush, my first rodeo, but most importantly my first white christmas. i did my best to fit in, and i did as my teachers said, but that year one teacher stood out from the rest. he didn't just stand out from the rest; he sung out. his name was mr hansen. and on a frosty december morning, he explained to us the story of the old standard "i'll be home for christmas". a tale of a world war ii soldier stationed overseas, writing a letter to his family about the return that he may never make. i saw it struck deep in him. now, it would be easy to describe mr hansen as brave. after all, this was a man who himself had served his country during the korean war. but getting up in front of twenty five nine-year-olds and singing a capella? that's a whole other kind of bravery altogether. the other kids were looking for the nearest escape: they couldn't bear the embarrassment. but not me. i was wrapped up in it. i couldn't help myself. i knew i was experiencing something different from the others, but i was uplifted so it didn't matter. i felt the isolation of war. i felt the power of a song, and that's the kind of thing that sticks with you. you don't let it go. and so, for this here christmas song, i have a friend i brought along. he's eighty six, but sounds like twenty, and though the other kids might find it funny, he'd like to sing his song for you, and if he doesn't mind i might join in too."
i'll be home for christmas
you can count on me
please have snow and mistletoe
and presents on the tree
oh christmas eve will find me
where the love light gleams
i'll be home for christmas
if only in my dreams
i'll be home for christmas
you can count on me
please have snow and mistletoe
and presents on the tree
oh christmas eve will find me
where the love light gleams
i'll be home for christmas
if only in my dreams
if only in my dreams
a police car was outside your house today
i haven't seen you, in a couple of days
they knocked on your door, and then they went away
your mother looked scared, but she didn't cry
she didn't cry
on one hand, i've got myself to blame
but on the other, it's always the same
follow suit shake your head, tell me that it's a lie
i don't want you for dead, but i want you to die
without a good friend, on a sunshine
i know i want survival, but you don't know why
where is she?
where is she?
where is my baby girl
i've seen you, you're crazy
what have you done with my whole wide world?
on one hand, i've got myself to blame
but on the other, it's always the same thing
follow suit shake your head, tell me that it's a lie
i don't want you for dead, but i want you to die
without a good friend, on a bad day
without a soft surrender, but what do you say?
all of these tears that we've cried
all of these tears that we've cried
where is she?
where is she?
where is my baby girl
oh i've seen you, you're crazy
what have you done with my whole wide world?
where is she?
where is she?
where is my baby girl
oh i've seen you and you're crazy
what have you done with my whole wide world?
what have you done with my whole wide world?
what have you done?
