with you
i held my breath and drove through a maze of wealthy homes
and i watched how green the trees were
and i watched how green the trees were
and i watched the steep walkways and the white fences
i gripped the wheel
i gripped the wheel
i gripped the wheel
i gripped the wheel
i sweated against the leather

i watched the dogs twist through the wealthy garden
i watched the dogs twist through the wealthy garden
i watched the dogs
i watched you lay on a towel in grass that exceeded the height of your legs
i gazed into reflective eyes
i cried against an ocean of light
an ocean of light
an ocean of light
crippled by the cushion, i sank into sheets
frozen by rose petal toes
my back shivered for your pressed granite nails
dishonest and ugly through the space in my teeth
break bones down to yellow and crush gums into blood
the hardest part for the weak
was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth
the hardest part for the weak
was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth

it's 5 am... and my heart flourishes at each passing moment
always and forever, always and forever

always and forever, always and forever

always and forever
drooling red from my eyes
to meet the bitter sun
that shines past into light
that shines past into light
setting fire to curtains
in hope that you’re dreaming
destroying the tomb
of memories from your life
destroying the tomb
of memories from your life
in the room full of family
but couldn’t find one, but couldn’t find one
in the hallways lit up brightly but couldn’t find myself
i laid drunk on the concrete on the day of your birth in celebration of all you were worth
i am my father’s son
i am no one
i cannot love
it’s in my blood

where has my passion gone?
has it been carried off
by some lonely driver in a line of fluorescent light?
has it been blurred together
in ribboned patterns on the night?
lines of a red light
blurred together in ribboned patterns
lines of a red light
blurred together in ribboned patterns
no!
light, light
along the stretch of some unnamed plane
we began again
i saw in your face that
we’re the same when we began again
along the stretch of some unnamed plane
i saw in your face
when we began again

destined as the servant to the night
where your moon dreams of the dirt
and the sharp tongue of your zealous will
is only congruent with the salt in your mouth
and the approaching eulogy of the world
lost in the patterns of youth
and the ghost of your aches comes back to haunt you
and the forging of change makes no difference
memories fly through the mask of your life
shielding you from time
the years that birthed the shell that you gained
hunched over in apathetic grief
with a disregard for steps except the one taken back
perched up on a rope crafted in smoke
a sword wielding death that buried your hope
focusing on light through the blinds
a slave to reality under a monarch in the sky
lost in the patterns of youth
where the windows shine brightly back at you
"twisting and turning beside the slumbering tereza, he recalled something she had told him a long time before in the course of an insignificant conversation. they had been talking about his friend z, when she announced, 'if i hadn't met you, i'd certainly have fallen in love with him.'
even then, her words had left tomas in a strange state of melancholy, and now he realized it was only a matter of chance that tereza loved him and not his friend z. apart from her consummated love for tomas, there were, in the realm of possibility, an infinite number of unconsummated loves for other men
we all reject out of hand the idea that the love of our life may be something light or weightless; we presume our love is what must be, that without it our life would no longer be the same; we feel beethoven himself, gloomy and awe-inspiring, is playing to our own great love."

to feel the gravel beneath my knees
to wake in a home

space where i could not escape
god had sent my calamity into

"he pained, shifting his attention toward the mirror across the road
back into his daydream
the spliff burned his fingers the second he drank, and he tossed it toward the gutter
the smoke burned into his eyes, blinding him
as he blinked through the tears, the pain began to recede
back down the promenade and homeward bound, as he approached the intersection of brooklyn and lakeshore, a flock of geese burst from the darkness and flew, shrieking into what was left of the evening."
in a dark tunnel
and new dawn approaching
with a sphere of light
ever glowing
and then the world will know
will know of you
of all things love
of all things true
"he looked up to watch them form a ghostly chevron with flashes of white from their exposed chest, blinking like so many eyes. crossing the street drenched him in fluorescent light, and he quickened his pace until he reached the softer light of the street lamps."

and let it go

breathe it in

by the precious blood of jesus christ
her sins will be judged
and god will cast you into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone
where there is weeping, and mashing of teeth
where the fire is never quenched and where the worm dieth not
it is a place called hell, and hell is real
jesus spoke more of hell than he did of heaven
and the loving warning
who was warned to flee the wrath of god
the bible says that because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for the day of wrath
where god’s righteous judgement will be prevailed
god offered you grace and mercy and forgiveness through the gospel
the bible says the gospel is the power of god and the salvation for all who believe, to the jews first, and then to the gentiles
the gospel message, gospel means good news
it's a message of hope, it’s a message of god's mercy
it's where god has demonstrated his love, by sending his son, his only begotten son, into the world, to seek and to save the lost

bowing to a monolith of grief
obsessing over discord
daydreaming of nights

i feel so worn, quartered, and torn
hung from the post
where my brothers once sung
cut from the tie
where my sanity binds

there is no such thing as
the past, present, or future
there just is
and it never goes away
i thought about you
for the rest of the day
catching my head
turning to find you again
i hated myself for it
i hated myself
i hated myself for it

biblical sky speckled with flame
do you hold your mother's eyes
from wetting the earth?
from weeping for those

they instead witness themselves

i spied along the concrete canvas
a woman, her eyes brimming with vacancy
and bear her hugging barbiturates
her head rolled from faint shoulders
and skipped three times
each thud sprouting a fountain
of splashing gold
stagnant strangers romance on crowded pathways
below admiring the stage's glistening coat
her reflection on the sill
giving the cheekbones their due
praising the worth of porcelain skin
my shades of blonde dancing in the high sun 
i gave labor to the grief
to the squinting spectator
who drank in the despair
as i tiptoed off the plane of existence and drifted listlessly
through the velvet blackness of oblivion
i am what i always was gleaming and empty 
i am what i always was
why? what have they done?
who has the culprit crossed and forced in another year?
why have some gone, but we are still here?
sitting in a circle of clouds
enforced upon my head
above my eager eyes
misplaced, my mind abandoned
seized to substance, abused in months of excess
heat flashes of memory breathing in good health
to stop the nightly excess
pounding on the walls
of the temple beside the cross
bury me in the bay
tempt me with throated swords no longer
bury me in the bay
oh, i am weary, i am tired
tired of leaping
collections of caskets
i am lurking death
an animal, a curse to myself
harms way for those i cherish

we're still laughing over lore
still talking about a stream of smoke
in the head of a shelter tank, swimmingly bored
swimming in monotony
swimming in ponds where our knees scrape the bottom
and still, we swallow the surface
where our knees scrape the bottom
and still, we swallow the surface
we brought our boredom to the lights
spoiled the city
blind to the ocean
deaf to the heavens
carving a shut-in symphony

doomed to be a spoiled child
a pupil in the eyes of forever

mystical, imaginary potential
that paused in glory with thoughts of ghosts
fled the ebbing, unknown wound
the disfigured prison of
resonant debauchery
seep, seeping through cracks
corroded with mold
blissfully ignorant insanity
misled prayers for sunshine
in the hopeless, godless cathedral
of rapid time

a roaring river of blood
