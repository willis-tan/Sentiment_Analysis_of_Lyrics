Hindered by sober restlessness
Submitting to the amber crutch
The theme in my aching prose
The theme in my aching prose
Fantasizing the sight of Manhattan
Fantasizing the sight of Manhattan
Manhattan
That pour of a bitter red being
That escapes a thin frame
A bitter red being
The rebirth of mutual love
The rebirth of mutual love
The slipping on gloves to lay
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly
The slipping on gloves to lay
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly
The slipping on gloves to lay
Slipping on gloves
Gloves, gloves
Slipping on gloves

I held my breath and drove through a maze of wealthy homes
And I watched how green the trees were
And I watched how green the trees were
And I watched the steep walkways and the white fences
I gripped the wheel
I gripped the wheel
I gripped the wheel
I gripped the wheel
I sweated against the leather
I sweated against the leather
I watched the dogs twist through the wealthy garden
I watched the dogs twist through the wealthy garden
I watched the dogs
I watched you lay on a towel in grass that exceeded the height of your legs
I gazed into reflective eyes
I cried against an ocean of light
An ocean of light
An ocean of light
Crippled by the cushion, I sank into sheets
Frozen by rose petal toes
My back shivered for your pressed granite nails
Dishonest and ugly through the space in my teeth
Break bones down to yellow and crush gums into blood
The hardest part for the weak
Was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth
The hardest part for the weak
Was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth
Was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth
It's 5 AM... and my heart flourishes at each passing moment
Always and forever, always and forever
It's 5 AM... and my heart flourishes at each passing moment
Always and forever, always and forever
Always and forever
Always and forever

Drooling red from my eyes
To meet the bitter sun
That shines past into light
That shines past into light
Setting fire to curtains
In hope that you’re dreaming
Destroying the tomb
Of memories from your life
Destroying the tomb
Of memories from your life
In the room full of family
But couldn’t find one, but couldn’t find one
In the hallways lit up brightly but couldn’t find myself
I laid drunk on the concrete on the day of your birth in celebration of all you were worth
I am my father’s son
I am no one
I cannot love
It’s in my blood
I am my father’s son
I am no one
I cannot love
It’s in my blood
I am my father’s son
I am no one
I cannot love
It’s in my blood

Where has my passion gone?
Has it been carried off
By some lonely driver in a line of fluorescent light?
Has it been blurred together
In ribboned patterns on the night?
Lines of a red light
Blurred together in ribboned patterns
Lines of a red light
Blurred together in ribboned patterns
No!
Light, light
Along the stretch of some unnamed plane
We began again
I saw in your face that
We’re the same when we began again
Along the stretch of some unnamed plane
I saw in your face
When we began again
A multiverse of fuchsia and violet
A multiverse of fuchsia and violet
Surrenders to blackness
Surrenders to blackness
My world closes its eyes to
Sex and laughter
My world closes its eyes to

Destined as the servant to the night
Where your moon dreams of the dirt
And the sharp tongue of your zealous will
Is only congruent with the salt in your mouth
And the approaching eulogy of the world
Lost in the patterns of youth
And the ghost of your aches comes back to haunt you
And the forging of change makes no difference
Memories fly through the mask of your life
Shielding you from time
The years that birthed the shell that you gained
Hunched over in apathetic grief
With a disregard for steps except the one taken back
Perched up on a rope crafted in smoke
A sword wielding death that buried your hope
Focusing on light through the blinds
A slave to reality under a monarch in the sky
Lost in the patterns of youth
Where the windows shine brightly back at you

"Twisting and turning beside the slumbering Tereza, he recalled something she had told him a long time before in the course of an insignificant conversation. They had been talking about his friend Z, when she announced, 'If I hadn't met you, I'd certainly have fallen in love with him.'
Even then, her words had left Tomas in a strange state of melancholy, and now he realized it was only a matter of chance that Tereza loved him and not his friend Z. Apart from her consummated love for Tomas, there were, in the realm of possibility, an infinite number of unconsummated loves for other men
We all reject out of hand the idea that the love of our life may be something light or weightless; we presume our love is what must be, that without it our life would no longer be the same; we feel Beethoven himself, gloomy and awe-inspiring, is playing to our own great love."

Tricked into some fodder about this oasis
This conversation of new beginning
Having enlightening talks over common interests
Chained together to push onto the celebrated platform
Chained together or chained forever
Chained together to push onto the celebrated platform tonight
I've boarded myself inside
I've refused to exit
There is no ocean for me
There is no glamour
Only the mirage of water ascending from the asphalt
I gaze at it from the oven of my home

There is no ocean for me
There is no glamour
Only the mirage of water ascending from the asphalt

I gaze at it from the oven of my home
Confined to a house that never remains clean
To a bed where the ill never get well
I cough ceaselessly into the night
The remainder of my humanity is drifting spit through the cold
Sitting quietly in scorching
Reimagined suburbia

Shadows extend east
And Cortazar
Stares at women
Shuffling by who blot their lips
From violent men
And say "god bless you"
From violent men
And say "god bless you"
I sulk with pause and
Loving mariachi soars
Against the red
And yellow tents of strangers
Shout!
The red and yellow tents of strangers
Gifting geese
The ends of bread
The ends of bread

8, 12, 13 hours
8, 12, 13 hours and
The people keep fighting for sleep

I'm reluctant to stay sad
Life beyond is a field
A field of flowers
A field of flowers
Life beyond is a field
My love is a nervous child lapping
From the glowing lagoon of their presence
A field of flowers
My love is a nervous child lapping
From the glowing lagoon of their presence
A field of flowers
My love is a bulging, blue-faced fool
Hung from the throat by sunflower stems
Hung from the throat by sunflower stems

I woke in a sweat from a desirous fever
In the pocket of yesteryear where faults have fallen to some
I begged not to carry the corpse
To not be a queer fish in unforgiving hearts
Unforgiving you
To not be buried in native clay and preserved for cynicism
I wish to be a pauper in kind eyes
To feel the gravel beneath my knees
To wake in a home
To feel the gravel beneath my knees
God had sent me into
Space where I could not escape
God had sent my calamity into
A deep space from which not even in dreams
Could I ever imagine my escape

"He pained, shifting his attention toward the mirror across the road
Back into his daydream
The spliff burned his fingers the second he drank, and he tossed it toward the gutter
The smoke burned into his eyes, blinding him
As he blinked through the tears, the pain began to recede
Back down the promenade and homeward bound, as he approached the intersection of Brooklyn and Lakeshore, a flock of geese burst from the darkness and flew, shrieking into what was left of the evening."

In a dark tunnel
And new dawn approaching
With a sphere of light
Ever glowing

And then the world will know
Will know of you
Of all things love
Of all things true

"He looked up to watch them form a ghostly Chevron with flashes of white from their exposed chest, blinking like so many eyes. Crossing the street drenched him in fluorescent light, and he quickened his pace until he reached the softer light of the street lamps."

Let it go as it grows on forever
And let it go
Let it go as it grows
Breathe it in
Let it go as it grows on forever
And we breathe it in
And we breathe it in
And then the world will grow
And then the world will grow
And then the world will know
Of all true love, true

Scrawled into the pavement, again and again
Written on the red stalls in smokey tin
On the smokey tin, it melts again and again
On the booths of the round table again
Drug onto the street and onto the soaking steps, again and again
All this debris sifting through static lungs, lingering
All this debris sifting through static lungs in every pore
Laced with a bitter face
Near the dawning of the high
Laced with a bitter face
Near the dawning of the high
Of the high
And madness of the undertow
We audience who saved our roses
We audience who scoffed at the tears
Ugliness stretching toward the chandelier
Pale with pain, pale with pain again
I imagined the overcome and fell to my knees
Before the endless truth of instability and futility
The endless truth of instability and futility
Now I know...

Hey, what’s up man?
I need three, you got em' with you?
Okay, but I’m not gonna do any of that waiting around
Uh...
Alright, I got enough for three, that’s it, I’m not cashing
I’m telling you man, I can’t- I don't think I... I can't cash you out
Alright?
By the precious blood of Jesus Christ
Her sins will be judged
And God will cast you into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone
Where there is weeping, and mashing of teeth
Where the fire is never quenched and where the worm dieth not
It is a place called Hell, and Hell is real
Jesus spoke more of Hell than he did of Heaven
And the loving warning
Who was warned to flee the wrath of God
The Bible says that because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for the day of wrath
Where God’s righteous judgement will be prevailed
God offered you grace and mercy and forgiveness through the gospel
The Bible says the gospel is the power of God and the salvation for all who believe, to the Jews first, and then to the Gentiles
The gospel message, gospel means good news
It's a message of hope, it’s a message of God's mercy
It's where God has demonstrated his love, by sending his son, his only begotten son, into the world, to seek and to save the lost
Eight 2-15's? Alright
Alright, man, just to let you know, I’ve been dicked around before, alright
I know, man, I’ve just been fucked around before, alright
I’ve got sixty bucks, that’s it, I told you I’ve got sixty bucks
I’ve got sixty bucks, that’s it, that’s all I have, that’s the last of my money

Benevolent, rich ritual of Death
Grave and porcelain
With baby blue lips and pale pink eyes

Submerging me into waves of icy seas

Seeing the last letters of my name

Growing somehow more beautiful

With all life profane
The ladles cradling
Streams of buttermilk
Current stretch out
And alabaster lips unseal
So I may recall
The soft timbre of
Whisper in its stillness
Still
Alabaster lips unseal
So I may recall
I may recall
The soft timbre of
Whisper in its stillness
Still
Now
When a fawn
Stumbles into the road
Honeydew high
And deep in afterglow
Mind swarming
Mind small
Honeydew high
Transforming the soul
On purple sand verbena
I forgive its delusion
Caress its world view
Super bloom
Shelter canary yellow eyes
Then search to pin the legs
Of the stalking dog
That lends its teeth
To sticky, sad bedlam
War cries quake through lurching light
I bury a blade between its ribs
Bear hug the soft canine frame
Then smear ash
Then smear the ash on its brow
All who have forgotten
Remember now
Remember now
Now

Bowing to a monolith of grief
Obsessing over discord
Daydreaming of nights
That led my staggering steps to nowhere
Bathing in the Summer night’s cold
And in the black of night
I feel so old
I feel so worn, quartered, and torn
Hung from the post
Where my brothers once sung
Cut from the tie
Where my sanity binds
Hung from the post
Where my brothers once sung
Cut from the tie
Where my sanity binds
Stuck in Winter’s Hell
With just you in mind
Waiting in the cold
Where we hide behind
I can’t move on
Because I can’t shed the weight of myself
I can’t move on
Because I can’t shed the weight of myself
There is no such thing as
The past, present, or future
There just is
And it never goes away
I thought about you
For the rest of the day
Catching my head
Turning to find you again
I hated myself for it
I hated myself
I hated myself for it
I hated myself
I hated myself for it
I hated myself
I hated myself

Biblical sky speckled with flame
Do you hold your mother's eyes
From wetting the earth?
From weeping for those
Who reward fame to absolutes of war?
Or for heroic myths
Provided to children
Married into ferocity?
They instead witness themselves
And the black sand of your body slipped through
And the black sand of your body slipped through
And the black sand of your body slipped through
And the black sand of your body
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I found myself at your side
I spied along the concrete canvas
A woman, her eyes brimming with vacancy
And bear her hugging barbiturates
Her head rolled from faint shoulders
And skipped three times
Each thud sprouting a fountain
Of splashing gold

Stagnant strangers romance on crowded pathways
Below admiring the stage's glistening coat
Her reflection on the sill
Giving the cheekbones their due
Praising the worth of porcelain skin
My shades of blonde dancing in the high sun 
I gave labor to the grief
To the squinting spectator
Who drank in the despair
As i tiptoed off the plane of existence and drifted listlessly
Through the velvet blackness of oblivion
I am what I always was - Gleaming and empty 
I am what I always was

Why? What have they done?
Who has the culprit crossed and forced in another year?
Why have some gone, but we are still here?
Sitting in a circle of clouds
Enforced upon my head
Above my eager eyes
Misplaced, my mind abandoned
Seized to substance, abused in months of excess
Heat flashes of memory breathing in good health
To stop the nightly excess
Pounding on the walls
Of the temple beside the cross
Bury me in the bay
Tempt me with throated swords no longer
Bury me in the bay
Oh, I am weary, I am tired
Tired of leaping
Collections of caskets
I am lurking death
An animal, a curse to myself
Harms way for those I cherish
I am tired
Done, forced in light
Versed to live as the child, on and on
I am home
I, I am home
Done, forced in light
I am home
Done, forced in light
I am home

We're still laughing over lore
Still talking about a stream of smoke
In the head of a shelter tank, swimmingly bored
Swimming in monotony
Swimming in ponds where our knees scrape the bottom
And still, we swallow the surface
Where our knees scrape the bottom
And still, we swallow the surface
We brought our boredom to the lights
Spoiled the city
Blind to the ocean
Deaf to the heavens
Carving a shut-in symphony
With memory's masturbation
I've talked it out
Doomed to be a spoiled child
A pupil in the eyes of forever
I knit the fire, I stared into the mirror
A prisoner to the past
A ghost to the present
Put down your glass
Don't raise a toast to your slaving
Bloodline now
Come to life
Put down your glass
Put down your glass
Don't raise a toast to your slaving
Bloodline now
Come to life
Walk the roads to Judah

Walk the roads to Judah

Walk the roads to Judah

Of all I knew
Her held too few
And would you stop me
If I try to stop you?
Old songs stay 'til the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way it is
I could leave it all
And I ask myself
Would you care at all?
When I drive alone at night
I see the streetlights as fairgrounds
And I tried a hundred times
To see the road signs as Day-Glo
Old songs stay 'til the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way it is
I could leave it all
And I ask myself
Would you care at all?
Would you care at all?

Imagining curving letters
In a languid psalm
In abstract time
Full levity rolling through
Intangible phantom mystery
And the furnace of gentle dreams
A caustic womb
Champagne light
After the sacred deep blue
Majesty of dawn
Naked and cordial and virgin
And virgin
Majesty of dawn
Naked and cordial and virgin
And virgin
Patience and poise
Twin ribbons bare
And make vivid
A dark shallow vein
Patience and poise
Twin ribbons bare
And make vivid
A dark shallow vein
Disguise and shame
Of all light downward
A gaunt fashion
Pulled tightly over peaking bone
A gaunt fashion
Pulled tightly over peaking bone
A small scene from in the smoking censer
A heart, a heart, a heart
The pulse of rotten roots
Twining through soil
Feasting on droplets
Rest come again
Come again
Rest crack puzzled
So urgent, wild
Rest crack puzzled
So urgent, wild, violent
Freedom flutters down
The drain again
One eye wide to the braille
Of fireflies
I tunnel brutishly
Pig headed
And full of steam
Full of steam
I tunnel brutishly
Pig headed
And full of steam
Into the damp comfort
Of this lonely trench
Of this trench
Of this trench

Barren, first
The golden nest
The budding breast
Bloated with
Mystical, imaginary potential
That paused in glory with thoughts of ghosts
Fled the ebbing, unknown wound
The disfigured prison of
Resonant debauchery
Seep, seeping through cracks
Corroded with mold
Blissfully ignorant insanity
Misled prayers for sunshine
In the hopeless, godless cathedral
Of rapid time
Like a tsunami of death
A roaring river of blood
Drowning the life
Out of all that was good
Drowning the life
That was good
Drowning the life
That was good
That was good

I married into the fly trap
I sunk into suburban sand
Victimized by restlessness
Blacking out in the lion's mouth
I laughed at the cigarette stain;
Inhaling black on the blinds
And cried at the digital bulb blasts
On the frames of my memory
I am transparent
Denied, segregate
From the obvious
Drunk and despairing, sick
"I loved a girl I'll never speak to again
I spoke to a girl I never stopped loving
I never stopped loving her"
I am transparent
Denied, segregate
From the obvious
Drunk and despairing, sick
I am transparent
Denied, segregate
From the obvious

Where has God gone wrong?
Shake the hand of your deepest fear
Was it not your hero who saw when you wept?
Could you call if you began to weep?
Where has God gone wrong?
Her glassy eyes still feel the warmth
So carry on to seas of bliss
And heal your heart with those you miss
Weighed down by stone doves
Hand in hand through dooms of love

Choked whines filter through the crack in the window
Where the sun fell through moments ago
And in this hour, the seas blows in the cataracts of his final day
His blessed concussed confusion
His seizing airways
He holds his head
Wishing for his mother
He takes to the cold
Where has the child gone?
Where has the child gone?
I thought he was anchored to his texts?
His revered studies?
He grew tired of the distant solar systems
And stopped counting his nightly collection of clouds
And he smudged the blood of his lover
And he smudged the blood of his lover
