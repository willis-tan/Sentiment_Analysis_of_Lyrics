Back in the '90s, I was in a very famous TV show (Ooh)
I'm BoJack the Horse (BoJack!), BoJack the Horse
Don't act like you don't know

And I'm trying to hold on to my past
It's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last
I guess I'll just try
And make you understand
That I'm more horse than a man
Or I'm more man than a horse
(BoJack!)

Mean man, promised land
Nothing but a devil's hand
Trying to keep saying I feel okay
Telling myself this now for days

Mean man, machine man
I've been nothing but a puppets hand
But nothing ever comes
Without a change

Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, yeah, yeah

You're such a big mess
And I love you

I am a man, man man man
Up, up in the air
And I run around, round round
Round this town town
And act like I don't care
So when you see me flying by the planet's moon
You don't need to explain if everything's changed
Just know I'm just like you

So I pull the switch, the switch, the switch inside my head
And I see black, black, green, and brown, brown, brown and blue
Yellow violets, red
And suddenly a light appears inside my brain
And I think of my ways, I think of my days
And know that I have changed

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
You've still got your hands

So mistress, mistress have you been up to the roof?
He shot himself, self
There's blood on the wall
Cause he couldn't face the truth
Oh, knock that down, leave the ground and find some space
And tell your friends, friends
You'll be back again-gain
Before it's too late

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

So I am a man, man, man, man
Up, up in the air
And I float around, round round
Round this town, town
And know I shouldn't care
So when you see us there, there out in the open road
You don't need to explain
If everything's changed
Just know that you don't know

We call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
We can't call it at all
We call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
When you can't call it at all
Yeah, we call it
Oh yeah that's what we call it
Ohhh
Yeah that's right, we call it
Ohhh
We do it for love, sweet love

Even when I can’t see my rear view
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day
Even when I sleep all day
Even if I order like I'm times two
Living in the back of a bunk just like we do
Even when I dream all day

Don’t wanna sleep tonight
You’ve got me feeling right

You remember that night when I hit a red light
And you pulled up next to me?
We were two young cats feeling under attack
Just making out in the street

It felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go

Yeah, you always took so right with your jeans all tight
Like you're walking in a magazine
Will you hold my hand, say you are my man
And you only have eyes for me?

Feel the rain come down and you know now
Put the fire out, you'll burn
Ever wonder how you can see now
That this landing ground is so
You know, you know, you know

Yeah I'm waiting on my mum and dad

Let's call it quits and see what the future holds
I've been here before, yeah, we just went down this road
A long time to feel young, short time to get old
I was holding onto something, knowing you would just let me go
Yeah, I was holding onto something, knowing you would just let me go
I love it when I get high, hate it when it gets cold
Indiscretion is a blessing if you know how the truth is told

But I don't feel my life is real
I'm on the fence with common sense

The tendency of time is to never understand it
The lesson of my life is to never comprehend it
No matter how much you spend trying to blend in
Or maybe on my deathbed I finally get an answer
Yeah, maybe on my deathbed I finally get an answer
Or tell me why it's always been this way
Indiscretion is a blessing if you know what you want to say

But I don't feel my life is real
I'm on the fence with common sense
Won't you enlighten me?
Won't you just set me free?

And that's just what I believe in

Yeah, we laughin' like a Wednesday night
We ran across the interstate
And drank a bottle of vinegar
And then we stayed up really late

Break it down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be
Bring it down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be

And I am what I am, a natural disaster
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
And maybe I'll come back for ya'
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinny-dippin'
And I can't understand what I'm after

So as we lay upon this ground, I swear you look like Lucifer
But green is blue, and so are you
And now we gone to Jupiter (Right now)
To Jupiter (Ah, shit)

Break it down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be

And I can't understand what I'm after

Swim, swim, swim in a swimming pool
The sky is blue, the trees are too
Swim, swim, swim from green to red
Go to bed, ya' sleepyhead
Swim, swim, swim in your swimming pool
Like swimmers do, I'll call on you

Yeah, I met somebody in a sea of people

I had a dream when I woke up today in bed,
I crawled around the ground, yeah, looking for my golden egg.
I lost my feet, I lost my hand, I lost my head.
When I looked up I saw a girl and this is what she said

Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away.
And I said...
Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away

Three times we climbed the stairs that never went no where
Tied up in basket, and she carried me to Febuary
Three times she marries me, but I was never there
Can't keep the family from changing me to what I am. Yeah...

Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away.
And I said...
Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away
Oh,
Nobody wants me here
Oh
Nobody wants me here

We saw a better life that came another way
Another set of eyes, surrounded me so natural
I trust the things in life that come another way
She has Velouria, a pile of bones is all I am.

Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away.
And I said...
Living without my shadow, living far away
Living without my shadow, living far away
Oh,
Nobody wants me here
Oh, oh, oh
Nobody wants me here
Oh,

Take it back to Saturday
I was in a k-hole
Laying out in the pouring rain
On and on and on, oh no
I could take the sky away
Put it in a payphone
Calling out all my mistakes
'Cause you don't know, you don't know

Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for..
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for..
Don't stop making it happen
I can't take it no more
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for..

You're the one who got away
And I just can't let go
How my mind keeps playing games
Dropping in before I drop out
Something 'bout that love we made
Put it in a payphone
Called you up, just had to say that
You don't know, you don't know

Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for..
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for..
Don't stop making it happen
I can't take it no more
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for..

And all the girls on the internet
In your private jet, yeah getting wet
All the boys come follow me

I had a little night on the weekend
I was just hanging from the ceiling
I shouldn't have my check up
'Cause no one really knows when it all runs out

And I don't even wild on the weekend
I don't even know if I mean it
See me never never no no no
See me never never no no no no
See me never never no no no no
And you don't have to run up in my bed
No, you don't have to run up in my bed

I just stand in the sun (yeah)
Warm my head in the sun (yeah)
Run around 'til it all stands still
I just wait in the sun

God says it's kind of hard to believe him
Something that's missing that feelin'
Find out how to be collected
Put it in a box and send it

And I don't even wild on the weekend
I don't even know if I mean it
See me never never no no no
See me never never no no no no
See me never never no no no no
And you don't have to run up in my bed
No, you don't have to run up in my bed

I just stand in the sun (yeah)
Warm my head in the sun (yeah)
Run around 'til it all stands still
I just wait in the sun

I just stand in the sun (I just stand in the sun)

Can't get it in no magazine
Can't get it in no drama queen
Cause I am my only escape
Trying to get all comfortable
Cause nothing is the way it was
And I am my only escape

And I'm leaving for tomorrow
I don't wanna come back home and feel the same
My heart, it's all crazy
I think it's time to run away

So meet me at the wishing well
If my dreams are real, I can't tell
Cause I am my only escape
I was trying to do the best I could
Cause nothing is the way it was
And I am my only escape

And I'm leaving for tomorrow
I don't wanna come back home and feel the same
My heart, it's all crazy
I think it's time to run away

I am my only, I am my only
I am my only, I am my only escape
I am my only

Cruising down the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach
And everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing
As we're sucking down that funny, funny weed
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And we're rolling up to sand
Take your shoes off, man
We are skinny dipping underneath the sea
And it's a chicken fight clan
Throw your dukes up, "wham!"
We are splashing in the water to the beat
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
(WeeeoooowhooOOOooooOOO)
Crossing sandy dunes
Hot day, mid-June
Naked kids, running wild, and free
It's summer time fun, relax and stay young
You could be home, with Oprah Winfrey
The water feels nice, dive deep down under
The ships, and treasures make reef
Just one of those days, had a blue, perfect wave
Come out, and join. You'll see
We are lying in the sun, when we're done find a towel
Now we're thinking of where we're gonna eat
Back corner table, order lobsters and Black Label
Raise your glasses, here's to living out our dreams
(Uuuuuhhhhhhnnnn)
Cruising down the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach
And everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing

Oh, I am guilty
Of feeling one way then the other
I looked the other way when I realized
Maybe I'm broken bread
'Cause where there's bread there's butter
Well, maybe I'm broken bread
When I realize I don't sleep
Yeah, I don't break

So tell me a story
Well, I'm in no hurry
I lay my head down
Against our baby now

Well maybe I've broken bone
But at least we're coming
We're gonna plant a tree on your birthday
Oh, I can't wait

So tell me a story
Well, I'm in no hurry
I lay my head down
Against our baby now
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I hit the ground, yeah I came in running
Was coming up when all the rain was pouring down
You'd never know that I was always spinning
I turn the corner and I pass right through the crowd

Me, I would never know
See, I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning
See, I can never grow
Me, I can never be
See, I can never go, the walls keep falling

Say here I stand
I was broken now I'm brave
Say here I am
Found my colours in the grey

My legs are tired, but I keep on pushing
I drop my hands and let my head fall heavy down
It's like I found my only child gone missing
I raise my arms up to the sky and show my crown

Me, I would never know
See I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning

Say here I stand
I was broken now I'm brave
Say here I am
Found my colours in the grey

Me, I would never know
See, I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning
Say here I am
And we'll stand until I'm gone

Woe to the end of the road
Everyone who's far away from home
And it's all that I know
Growing up and growing old

Me, I would never know
See I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning

Say here I stand
I was broken now I'm brave

Me, I would never know
See I can never wait
Me, I can never stop my world from spinning
Say here I am
And we'll stand until I'm gone

Back in '07, I was in a not-successful TV show
I'm BoJack the Horseman (Goddamn!)
What the hell was I thinkin', bro?

When you're an artist
Yeah, it's hard to play it safe
That show stumbled hard
Right out the starting gate
Wonder if I'm ever
Gonna get another chance
Maybe a listicle at best
Yeah, I'm not a horse, I'm an ass
(Bojack!)

I've been sleeping in a bus mistrust singing lalalala (ooh)
I got the feeling I was nickel and dimed
That was probably in line for the semiconscious state of mind (ooh)
Rush, rush, rush for the gold dust scattered too much
I'm sippin cocktails, fish scales, falling for love

Yeah we laid down in the sand
You took my clothes off with your hands
I gotta say you look real pretty
All the way from New York City
And the sunlight in your eyes
Pins and needles
No surprise
And the moon shines in your hair
Can you believe it, we're really here
And it's all handled
You close your eyes and count to ten
Don't swallow any seaweed
Or if you do you're starting again
You either didn't or you did
Talking 'bout talking from within
Talking 'bout how you wanna live
We call it metamorphosis
Yeah this is metamorphosis
And the sunlight in your eyes
Pins and needles no surprise
And the moon shines in your hair
Can you believe it we're really here

Ready to jump off

Quarter, dime and penniless
In a parking lot

I got a black cat baby and it's packed away
I got a black cat baby and it's wrapped around my leg

Ow!

I was just a schoolboy
I got no place to go
(Got no place to go)
Spent the afternoons alone on my kitchen floor
(On the kitchen floor)
Oh, mommy's late from work
She's stopping at the store
Whoa-oh, oh oh
Oh, this is how it goes

She was just a schoolgirl
She thought she met a dream
Or so it seems, so it seems
I spent some summer nights
Wrapped up in her backyard
Oh, I was so in love
And then I fell apart

Oh, when the room stood still
Oh, oh when the room stood still

(Make me up, Make me up)
Or else I could tell you why
(Make me up, Make me up)
You're the reason I'm alive
(This is how you remember me now)
And just out the door is killing me
Oh, oh

And it was all so hazy
Running 'round this river town
The time we spent was here
And it can drive me crazy
Thinking 'bout that schoolboy
And how he disappeared

Oh, when the room stood still
Oh, when the room stood still

(Make me up, Make me up)
Oh, I wish I could tell you why
(Make me up, Make me up, oh)
You're the reason I'm alive
(This is how you remember me now)
And just out the door is killing me

And all my
Secrets wrapped around
This golden crown
And buried backwards
Behind my house
It's in the ground
And always wondered when
You'll come and dig it out
Oh no!

Make me up, Make me up, oh
Make me up, Make me up, oh
This is how you remember me
And something's always killin' me

(Make me up, make me up)
Oh, I wish I could tell you why
(Make me up, Make me up)
Last time in my life
(This is how you remember me now)
And something's always killin' me

Make me up, make me up
Make me up, Make me up
This is how you remember me (now!)
This is how you remember me (now!)

Not now
I was just a schoolboy, I got no ehh

Go ahead and close the door
I'll stand outside in the rain
A little bird just told me so
It's time to start over again
So I'll man up and take this boat
Far away from these shores
And I'll reach behind an enemy line
And find my curable cure

'Cause it's a cruel and beautiful world
And I got my girl
And if it seems like we're falling behind
Or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind

I buried a treasure far off near the desert
I'm trying to find my way there
It's been too long since I've been myself
And my eyes can't see anymore
But there's a song inside this heart of mine
And I'd like to sing it to you
'Cause there's an earthquake shaking inside my country
Now what am I gonna do?

'Cause it's a cruel and beautiful world
And I got my girl
And if it seems like we're falling behind
Or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind
Hey
'Cause it's a cruel and beautiful world (Cruel and beautiful world)
And I got my girl (He's got his girl)
And if it seems like we're falling behind (Seems like we're falling behind)
Or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind

Betty's a bombshell, she just got paid
Crossing the street on passionate gates
Billy's a looker, he's from upstate
He ran into Betty and he took her on a date
And it's a sunny day, we will go away, on a holiday
And it's a sunny day, we will go away, on a holiday
And it's okay, all the suffering obliterates our speed
But don't you wait (don't you wait) for the faster you let go you will receive what you need
Ohh ohh ohh
And Betty said Billy why you makin' that face
Since you moved in you've been on a different page
You've been out of commission, hiding in the kitchen
Freddy came over and you couldn't even listen
It's a great escape from your heartache its your replay
It's a great escape from your heartache its your replay
And it's okay, all the suffering obliterates our speed
But don't you wait (don't you wait) for the faster you let go you will receive what you need
Its okay, all the suffering obliterates our speed

Won't you find this little heart of mine
I buried it deep inside
Next to my lazy eye
Oh won't you be
(Hey!)
Oh won't you be
In my life, talking 'bout all the time
Everything feels so right
You're such a friend of mine
Oh won't you be
Standing next to me
Yeah, won't you find
This little heart of mine
There's a fire across the bay
My mind was made of
There's a fire across the bay

Cannonball
Cannonball
You're kicking on back when the zig-zag put you on the floor
But the Beach Boys bring that endless summer to your room
From the dive bar you can make it to that sold-out show
And you want that sacred love, won't you just make it so
But if things stop and lock down
Got to bend that ear near to the ground
And every time you get lost, get found
And when you raise up that glass, drink it down
Like hand-written mail we're just tales that are soon forgotten
Sink your teeth in the flesh of this new horizon
Had 'em screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
Being cannonball, bringing all hell to the board
Being cannonball
Cannonball
Got me screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
I'm a cannonball, bringing all hell to the floor
Through the rooftop, through that gridlock, through the alleyways
If the world's your canvas, just pick up that brush and paint
If you're caught between a rock and me and watch you wait
Better find another route, don't even fucking hate
I'll follow ya
As if you were my lover
Yeah even if the dance is lost
And we're all going under
Like hand-written mail we're just tales that are soon forgotten
Sink your teeth in the flesh of this new horizon
Had 'em screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
Be a cannonball, bringing all hell to the board
Be cannonball
Cannonball
Got me screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
I'm a cannonball, bringing all hell to the floor
Cannonball
Oh coming down
You know you got me
Bringing all hell to the board
Cannonball
Bringing all hell to the board
Cannonball
Bringing all hell to the board
Bringing all hell to the board
Got me screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
I'm a cannonball, bringing all hell to the floor

Dim the lights, dim the lights, dim the lights, low
You can come and join me, sit around the piano
You can light the fire, open up the window
You can make a choice by seeing where the wind blows
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming
You can change the channel and I can change the feeling
Call my name, call my name, call my name out
You can find the key and I can find the way out
Honestly, tell me, tell me what you like
I can sit awake from midnight to daylight
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming
You can change the channel and I can change the feeling

Chloe, I don't need a reason
Well, I'm bound by the sweet condition
Chloe, we don't need permission
We can go where we wanna go
Say what we wanna say, and
Do what we wanna do
Dim the lights, dim the lights, dim the lights, low
You can come and join me, sit around the piano
You can light the fire, open up the window
You can make a choice by seeing where the wind blows
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming
You can change the channel and I can change the feeling
Chloe, I don't need a reason
Well, I'm bound by the sweet condition
Chloe, we don't need permission
We can go where we wanna go
Say what we wanna say, and
Do what we wanna do
You can find me in a web outside
I'm waiting here to be untied
We can fly through the sky tonight
You can have everything
Let me say one more time:
Chloe, I don't need a reason
Well, I'm bound by the sweet condition
Chloe, we don't need permission
We can go where we wanna go
Say what we wanna say, and
Do what we wanna do
We can go where we wanna go
Say what we wanna say, and

So you travel around this country
You're looking for your holy ghost
And what you gonna find?
Is it somewhere you like to hide?
So you'll run around your ego
You'll run around your gold coast
You know you got the time
Because this prison is our own design

So you're thinking of your future
Your thinking of some old past
And it's your time to shine
So what you gonna go and leave behind?
And there's no one to be in with
There's nothing left downstairs
And when you feel despair
What's your method to get out of there?

So where you from son? And are you a troubled one?
And if so come under my wing
And what's your story? And is there glory or hate?
Cause that is the only way I think

So you run around this earth top
You run around your head mouth
And what you want to find is peace of mind
Of which you can't describe
And it's definitely something, it's definitely somewhere
You know the signs are there
Call it a fable or just be unfair

So where are you from girl? And will you paint my world?
And if so come under my wing
And what's your story? And is there glory or hate?
Cause that's the only way I think

I knew what you got today
Heard you're gonna bring it down
But that’s a lesson hard to learn
She makes you feel out of control
Just like that night in New York
When you went drowning all alone
But she's your gi-i-i-i-i-i-irl
She's your gi-i-i-i-i-i-irl
She's your gi-i-i-i-i-i-irl
She's your gi-irl
You're just gonna sit around waiting till she walks away
You just gotta let it go, let it go, let it go
When you're gonna stand up, baby, you can be so brave
You just gotta let it go, let it go, let it go
I let it go, let it go, let it go
But she's your gi-i-i-i-i-i-irl
She's your gi-i-i-i-i-i-irl
She's your gi-i-i-i-i-i-irl

And every time you failed to walk away she'll bring you down, down, down, down
And every time the shade is back that day she'll bring you down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Gi-i-i-i-i-i-irl

I give you this, you give it back
I tossed a coin right on the track
Is this for real or is it whack?
I hate the feelin' of feelin' trapped
Somethin' for nothin', yeah
And it doesn't matter where I live
After a while I wanna split
You specialize in twice as nice
I fall asleep but not at night
Somethin' for nothin', yeah

What I know
I march in my own parade
I don't know
It's all just utter pain
I don't care
I plan out my escape
I don't know
What else can I say?

Yeah less is more, I know the tale
But what if it feels like you have doubt?
Could it be in your head or in your home?
Ain't it nice to know you're not alone?
Somethin' for nothin', yeah

Bless the farmer planting his seeds
Pull away that poison ivy
I dig all day to make a clearing
Trouble goes away, the clouds are disappearing
I'm so alert, the only side of the dirt
Another day of some honest work

E-I, E-I, E-i-O-O
We like, we like to watch it grow
You-I, me-I, she-I must know
When everything around us is going dim

Then one morning, I woke from my dream
Saw my landlord staring at me
He said, "Pay me or you'll have to leave
You got 'til the end of the day"

E-I, E-I, E-i-O-O
We got, we got self-control
You-I, me-I, she-I must go
'Cause nothing really lasts forever

Oh, at the empty end of the road
You've seen all the piles of gold
I wanna stay right here

Don't got to tell me, I already know
It starts beautiful, then goes casino
Oh, place your bets on what comes next
I bet we all gonna get ice cream

E-I, E-I, E-i-O-O
We are, we are on our own
You-I, me-I, she-I must go
Into the great unknown
E-I, E-I, E-i-O-O

The night's so young, let's set it on fire
(Buncha kids and we're playin' with matches, yeah)
Yeah, the night's so young, let's set it on fire

Want nothin' more than for you to take a ride with me

Should I reconsider all the side effects before I get ahead of myself, ahead of myself?
I know my liver must be mad at me because I just neglect my health, neglect my health

They say I do too much
Well, there ain't much time
I think I’m losin' touch, missin' all the good times
Is it your ego? Or is it all that pride?
It must be tough for you, holding that shit inside

Let’s do some shit we won't remember
We'll be great pretenders
One more and then I'm goin' home
There'll be no worries 'bout tomorrow
Now there's time to borrow
One more and then I’m goin’ home

I know I said last time was the last time but for real this is the last time now, the last time now
If you don't ask questions I won’t even second guess it when we're spinning out, I'm spinning out

You'll just fall apart to let the world fall back on me
Yeah, only you can see
I'll make you feel alright
But it's only temporary time you'll spend with me
Your temporary time, so we'll just fall off

Is it your ego? Or is it all that pride?
It must be tough for you, holding all that shit inside

Let's do some shit we won't remember
We'll be great pretenders

Flowers don't grow here anymore
They've left these shores and you wonder why
(Yeah, you wonder why)
Wildlife, they've left behind these doors
While there once was applause, there's only empty skies
(Only empty skies)

And skies are only empty if you don't got time
Might as well lie down and find yourself some rope
And if you're looking through that looking glass and cry
Then you know, you know your life is not a joke

Flowers don't grow here anymore
Their people are tall and don't know where they lie
(Don't know where they lie)
I was uncomfortable with everything that passed me by
Yet the depth was my ride
(Ride, ride, ride)
And if the flowers die they'll grow again, I'll tell you why
Yeah 'cause that's their life
(Life, life, life)

And if those skies are empty and you don't got time
Might as well lie down and find yourself some rope
And if you're looking through that looking glass and cry
Then you know, you know your life is not a joke

One two one two three four
Yeah I step outta of my little country
I traveled seasons, took a longboat
And now I find myself in a small town
It's so remote I couldn't trawl
So I kissed my mommy, oh on her sweet cheeks
And I told my dad I'm real glad that we're friends
Said to my brother I'll surely miss him
I'm coming back I just don't know when
Waited enough to find the truth
The pain, again they say oh well
Don't say oh well
Don't say oh well
And I told my band mates, they are my soul mates
And I hope we can understand
That this year has been a big one, yeah
We following what we don't plan
So do you got that sweet devotion
Oh will you follow your heart's plan
Oh why not jump in to that ocean
And run your fingers through your hair
Waited enough to find the truth
The pain, again they say oh well
Don't say oh well
Don't say oh well
Don't say oh well

Nothin' disappoints me like the news
Nothin' disappoints me
Nothing's gonna hit you like the truth
Nothing's gonna hit you

Through a reporter
You're just followin' orders
Closin' your eyes and tellin' lies
While they're taking our daughters

Nobody been keepin' their promises
Somebody better keep their promises
Nobody been keepin' their promises
Need somebody to keep their promises

I got news for you, Uncle Sam
I got no use for you
You're just another made up man
In a stupid costume

Here comes a magician and he's got no tricks
Wants to cut the ladies in half
He ain't seen the future like we all did
'Cause he's livin' in the dark ages

Nobody been keepin' their promises
Somebody better keep their promises
Nobody been keepin' their promises
Need somebody to keep their promises
Nobody been keepin' their promises
Somebody better keep their promises
Nobody been keepin' their promises
Need somebody to keep their promises

How many bullets does it take
To put a hole in the light?
They keep telling us we have to wait
We ain't got the time

Every day's a cheat day, a cheat day
Put on by a cheapskate, a cheapskate
We're all in a deep state, a deep state
A deep state of delusion

Nobody been keepin' their promises
Somebody better keep their promises
Nobody been keepin' their promises
Need somebody to keep their promises
Nobody been keepin' their promises
Somebody better keep their promises
Nobody been keepin' their promises
Need somebody to keep their promises

This is all I got left
A broken record and a dog
If I'm bein' honest
This'll be our last song
Dirty little secret
Buried in my backyard
Tell me I might reach it
At least it got me this far

Burial
I’m broken but you can’t break me
Burial
Oh, they put me in the ground with the dead leaves, yeah
(Ooh)

This is all I got left
My middle finger all night long
I’m a little off it
But nothin' like a lost cause
Catch me when I’m nervous
Listen to my sad song
Nobody is perfect
You'll know it now that I'm gone

Burial
I’m broken but you can't break me
Burial
You put me in the ground with the dead leaves
Burial
Love is just a game that I cannot see
Burial
Ooh, you're dead to me, yeah

Burial, burial
Burial
Burial, burial
Damn
Woah

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

Oh, lets be friends
And we'll hold hands
As those trains go passin' by
Yeah girls are girls, all over this world
But theres only one tonight
And if those stars above
They ain't shown love, then you're looking through the clouds
So I'm gonna get giddy somehow
Get giddy somehow
Yeah I swear I'll come around
Oh won't you get giddy somehow?
Get giddy somehow
Yeah don't let life tie you down
So laughing ghost, you've come to toast, everything that haunts me now
You say I'm fallible yeah, and I'm so malleable
But I'm wearing a new crown
And if those stars above
They ain't shown love, then you're looking through the clouds
So I'm gonna get giddy somehow
Get giddy somehow
Yeah I swear I'll come around
Oh won't you get giddy somehow?
Get giddy somehow

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
When I go outside
Will you wait out here in this getaway car?
When times are hard
We can escape
And if I lose my mind
Will you take me up in a shooting star
And we'll get real far
'Cause we'll never break
You see me in a state you see me make mistakes
As you leave
See me stand in the dark 'cause you don't need me
You see me at my worst, hurt me say some words
That I don't mean
I don't mean to break your heart
For we'll get away
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
When my lights are low
We must get away far
And we're travelling on this open road
And the cold wind blows
Will you come to me?
And when the sun is high
And we hear a dozen jets fly by
Will we touch the sky?
Touch the sky
You see me in a state you see me make mistakes
As you leave
See me stand in the dark 'cause you don't need me
You see me at my worst, hurt me say some words
That I don't mean
I don't mean to break your heart
For we'll get away
We must get away far
Paper planes will never turn us round
Business will never slow us down
We will never be seen on every dawn
'Cause we'll get away
In this getaway car
Oh get away
We must get away far
We'll get away
We must get away far

Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?
It's a big black sky over my town
I know where you at, I bet she's around

Yeah, I know it's stupid, I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
(I keep dancing on my own)

I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line
Stilettos and broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
(I keep dancing on my own)

So far away, but still so near
(The lights go on, the music dies)
But you don't see me standing here
(I just came to say goodbye)

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
(I keep dancing on my own)
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh
I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
(I keep dancing on my own)

I keep dancing on my own

It's nice to know that you're underground
It's nice to know, never lost or found
And the hillside covers you through town
Snowflakes block the view and ground
Ma, ma, ma, ma, come see
Woah, woah
Dad, dad, dad, dad, look at me
Woah, woah
Ma, ma, ma, ma, come see
Woah, woah
Dad, dad, dad, dad, look at me
It's nice to know that you'll never grow
It's nice to know deep beneath the snow
And the hillside covers you through town
Snowflakes block the view and ground
Ma, ma, ma, ma, come see
Woah, woah
Dad, dad, dad, dad, look at me
Woah, woah
Ma, ma, ma, ma, come see
Woah, woah
Dad, dad, dad, dad, look at me
Woah, woah, oooooh
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, oooooh
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, oooooh
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, oooooh
Woah, woah
It's nice to know that you're underground

I didn’t ask for this
You give me heart attack
I didn’t want to care
And then I saw you there
Been working like a dog
I turned all my dreams off
I didn’t know my name (x2)

(I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go (x2)
(Oh I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

Even when I can’t see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day (x2)
Even if I’m… (??)
Living in the back of the room just like we do
Even when I dream all day

Don’t wanna sleep tonight
You’ve got me feeling right
I didn’t know my name (x2)

(I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go (x2)
(Oh I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

Even when I can’t see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day (x2)
Even if I’m… (??)
Living in the back of the room just like we do
Even when I dream all day (x2)
(instrumental break)
Whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa (x3)
Whoa

(Oh I got a little bit longer) I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh

Even if I smoke in the back room
Even if I go right to meet you
Even when I sleep all day (x2)
Even if I’m… (??)
Waiting for the day just to end so I see you
Even when I dream all day (x2)
D-d-d-day, etc
(Whoa-oh Whoa-oh oh) (x3)
Oh
Day
