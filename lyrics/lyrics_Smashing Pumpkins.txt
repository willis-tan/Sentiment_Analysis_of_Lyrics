Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see

That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Time is never time at all
You can never ever leave
Without leaving a piece of youth
And our lives are forever changed
We will never be the same
The more you change the less you feel

Believe
Believe in me
Believe, believe
That life can change
That you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same
We're different

Tonight (tonight)
Tonight, so bright
Tonight (tonight)

And you know you're never sure
But you're sure you could be right
If you held yourself up to the light
And the embers never fade
In your city by the lake
The place where you were born

Believe
Believe in me
Believe, believe
In the resolute urgency of now
And if you believe there's not a chance

Tonight (tonight)
Tonight, so bright
Tonight (tonight)

We'll crucify the insincere tonight (tonight)
We'll make things right
We'll feel it all tonight (tonight)
We'll find a way to offer up the night tonight
The indescribable moments of your life (tonight)
The impossible is possible tonight (tonight)
Believe in me as I believe in you

Tonight...
Tonight, tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight...

The world is a vampire
Sent to drain
Secret destroyers
Hold you up to the flames
And what do I get
For my pain?
Betrayed desires
And a piece of the game

Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

Now I'm naked
Nothing but an animal
But can you fake it
For just one more show?
And what do you want?
I wanna change
What do you got
When you feel the same?

Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, yeah
Tell me I'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son, for you

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
And someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage!

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a…
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a…
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, for you

And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved

Today is the greatest
Day I’ve ever known
Can’t live for tomorrow
Tomorrow’s much too long
I’ll burn my eyes out
Before I get out

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I’ve ever known
Can’t wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I’ll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day

I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you

Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever really known
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my choice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love, I send this smile over to you

Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my voice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love, I send this smile over to you

The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you

Fool enough to almost be it
Cool enough to not quite see it
Doomed
Pick your pocket, full of sorrow
And run away with me tomorrow
June

We’ll try and ease the pain
But somehow, we’ll feel the same
Well, no one knows
Where our secrets go

I send a heart to all my dearies
When your life is so, so dreary
Dream
I’m rumored to the straight and narrow
While the harlots of my perils
Scream

And I fail
But when I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will


Mother, weep the years I’m missing
All our time can’t be given
Back
Shut my mouth and strike the demons
That cursed you and your reasons
Out of hand and out of season
Out of love and out of feeling
So bad

When I can, I will
Words defy the plans
When I can, I will

Fool enough to almost be it
And cool enough to not quite see it
Dull enough to always feel this
Always old, I’ll always feel this
No more promise, no more sorrow
No longer will I follow
Can anybody hear me?
I just want to be me

And when I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will

My reflection, dirty mirror
There's no connection to myself
I'm your lover, I'm your zero
I'm the face in your dreams of glass
So save your prayers
For when we're really gonna need 'em
Throw out your cares and fly
Wanna go for a ride?

She's the one for me
She's all I really need (oh yeah)
She's the one for me

Emptiness is loneliness
And loneliness is cleanliness
And cleanliness is godliness
And God is empty just like me

Intoxicated with the madness
I'm in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth
I never let on that I was on a sinking ship
I never let on that I was down

You blame yourself
For what you can't ignore
You blame yourself for wanting more

She's the one for me
She's all I really need
She's the one for me
She's my one and only
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Freak out and give in
Doesn't matter what you believe in
Stay cool
And be somebody's fool this year
'Cause they know
Who is righteous, what is bold
So I’m told

Who wants honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Hipsters unite
Come align for the big fight to rock (for you)
But beware
All those angels with their wings glued on
'Cause deep down
They are frightened and they're scared
If you don't stare

Who wants honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out


Tell me all of your secrets
Cannot help but believe this is true
Tell me all of your secrets
I know, I know, I know
Should have listened when I was told

Who wants that honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Nothing left to say
And all I’ve left to do
Is run away from you
And she led me on, down
With secrets I can’t keep

Close your eyes and sleep
Don’t wait up for me
Hush now, don’t you speak
To me

Wrapped my hurt in you
And took my shelter in that pain
The opiate of blame
Is your broken heart, heart, your heart
Soma

I’m all by myself
As I’ve always felt
And I’ll betray my tears
To anyone caught
In our ruse of fools

One last kiss for me, yeah
One last kiss good night

Didn’t want to lose you once again
Didn’t want to be your friend
Fulfilled a promise made of tin
And crawled back to you

I’m all by myself
(Close your eyes and sleep)
As I’ve always felt
(Don't wait up for me)
I’ll betray myself
(Hush now, don't you speak)
To anyone, lost, anyone but you


So let the sadness come again
On that you can depend on me, yeah
Until the bitter, bitter end of the world, yeah
When God sleeps in bliss

I’m all by myself
As I’ve always felt
I’ll betray myself
To anyone

...and you need to resist the devil so that he will flee

What moonsongs
Do you sing your babies?
What sunshine do you bring?
Who belongs?
Who decides who’s crazy?
Who rights wrongs where others cling?

I’ll sing for you
If you want me to
I’ll give to you
And it’s a chance I’ll have to take
And it’s a chance I’ll have to break

I go along
Just because I’m lazy
I go along to be with you
And those moonsongs
That you sing your babies
Will be the songs to see you through

I’ll hear your song
If you want me to
I’ll sing along
And it’s a chance I’ll have to take
And it’s a chance I’ll have to break

I’m in love with you
I’m in love with you
I’m in love with you
I’m in love with you
(So in love)
I’m in love with you
(With you)
I’m in love with you
I’m in love with you
(So in love)
I’m in love with you
(I’m so in love)
I’m in love with you
With you
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Speak to me in a language I can hear
Humor me before I have to go
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late, supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again

I know I'll make it, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth

And you can make it last forever, you
You can make it last forever, you
Can make it last

And for a moment, I lose myself
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
I've journeyed here and there and back again
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Sympathies I'm ready to return

I'll make the effort, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse
Tomorrow's just an excuse

And you can make it last forever, you
Can make it last forever, you
Can make it last forever, you
Forever, you

It’s you that I adore
You’ll always be my whore
You’ll be the mother to my child
And a child to my heart

We must never be apart
We must never be apart

Lovely girl, you’re the beauty in my world
Without you, there aren’t reasons left to find

And I’ll pull your crooked teeth
You’ll be perfect, just like me
You’ll be a lover in my bed
And a gun to my head

We must never be apart
We must never be apart

Lovely girl, you're the murder in my world
Dressing coffins for the souls I've left to die
Drinking mercury to the mystery
Of all that you should ever leave behind
In time

In you, I see dirty
In you, I count stars
In you, I feel so pretty
In you, I taste god
In you, I feel so hungry
In you, I crash cars

We must never be apart

Drinking mercury
To the mystery of all that you should ever seek to find
Lovely girl, you’re the murder in my world
Dressing coffins for the souls I’ve left behind
In time

We must never be apart

And you’ll always be my whore
'Cause you’re the one that I adore
And I’ll pull your crooked teeth
You’ll be perfect, just like me
In you, I feel so dirty
In you, I crash cars
In you, I feel so pretty
In you, I taste god

We must never be apart

Faith lies in
The ways of sin
I chased the charmed
But I don’t want them anymore (Yeah, yeah)
And in their eyes, I was alive
A fool’s disguise
Take me away from you
Shame my tongue
Fat with promise all along
When I woke up from that sleep
I was happier than I’d ever been
When you decide
That your life is a prize
Renew and revive
It’s alright, honey
It’s alright, yeah
Happiness will make you wonder
Will I feel OK?
It scares the disenchanted
Far away

Yeah, I want something new
But what am I supposed to do about you?
Yeah, I love you, it’s true
Life’s a bummer
When you’re a hummer
Life’s a drag, yeah, yeah
Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain’t free
Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain’t free
Do you feel
Love is real?
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I know we’re just like old friends
We just can’t pretend
That lovers make amends
We are reasons so unreal
We can’t help but feel that something has been lost
But please, you know you’re just like me
Next time, I promise we’ll be
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect strangers down the line
Lovers out of time
Memories unwind
So far, I still know who you are
But now, I wonder who I was…
Angel, you know it’s not the end
We’ll always be good friends
The letters have been sent on
So please, you always were so free
You’ll see, I promise we’ll be
Perfect
Perfect strangers when we meet
Strangers on the street
Lovers while we sleep
Perfect
You know this has to be
We always were so free
We promised that we’d be
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect

Blur like a rocket
Torch like a dying sun
Snap like a dragon
Dive like a pelican
Kingdoms of my kingdom come
Skip like a prophet
Spit like a poet’s gun
But say how long can this go on?

Stumbling before you speak
Stunning and stunning and stunning the black
You turn turncoat
Inward to seek out all your hopes
It's your signals
That hurts me most

We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts

Rule like a tyrant
Make like a valentine
Tear like a siren
Sulk like a sunken mine
Kingdoms of my kingdom come
It’s all but one, so
Row like a felon
Drown like a captain's son
But say how long can this go on?

We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts

Stumbling before you speak
Stunning and stunning with cannons to lead
And tigers tight
You scan the fields, someone dies tonight
It’s tragic, but at least it’s not you

We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts
We’re in the middle
We’re in the middle
Ghosts

Feel it
Break your bones
Mr. Jones
Taste me
As I bleed
Taste my need

And Spaceboy, I've missed you
Spinning round my head
And any way you choose me
You'll break instead

Watch me
Death defy
Defile my life
I don't need
I don't care
Please
I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
'Cause when a lover aches
That's when a lover breaks
I want to go home
I want to go home

And Spaceboy, they'll kill me
Before I'm dead and gone
And any way you choose me
It won't be wrong
And anyway you choose me
We won't belong

We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong

Now it’s, uh, kind of strange, and, uh, kinda hard for me to talk about, but I thought maybe you could help- um, when we start getting physical, rather than having intercourse, he ends up just masturbating himself, and I end up feeling very alienated and unsatisfied, and it’s really come between us

Ten times removed
I forget about where it all began
Bastard son of a bastard son of
A wild-eyed child of the sun
And right as rain, I'm not the same but
I feel the same, I feel nothing

Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again

I sensed my loss
Before I even learned to talk
And I remember my birthdays
Empty party afternoons won't come back

Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again

I forget to forget me
I forget to forget, you see
Nothing is important to me

I knew my loss
Before I even learned to speak
And all along, I knew it was wrong
But I played along, with my birthday song

Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again

Burn down the sun
I’m not everyone
High and dry
Nothing but a body in my mind
I’m here to stay
They're here today
High and dry
Nothing but a body in my mind
I’m nothing but a body in my mind
I feel that something ain’t right
No fear but reasons that I can’t cite
Tear down the sun
Bring down the sun
I’m not everyone
I’m not everyone
I’m not everyone
Unholy sin
Unholy fate
High and dry
Nothing but a body in my mind
I’m left to ash
Not here but past
High and dry
Nothing but a body in my mind
I am nothing but a body in my mind
I feel that something ain’t right
No fear but reasons that I can’t cite
Tear down the sun
Bring down the sun
I'm not everyone
I'm not everyone
I'm not everyone
Burn down the sun
Speculation
Come on, get yourself together
Speculation
Become the owl at midnight
Situation
I am the seer, I am the seeker
Situation
Become the one that fights you
Become the one that fights you
Become the owl at midnight
Become the owl at midnight
High and dry
I'm ash made time
With sun, too bright
I am nothing but a body in my mind
I am nothing but a body in my mind
Tear down the sun
Bring down the sun
I’m not everyone
I’m not everyone
Burn down the sun

Trees and balloons
Ice cream snow
See you in June (June)


Could have known

Should have known
I would conceal your way

She knows

How’s it

Color show
After the moon
I should go
See you in June
Your way

She knows

And she knows, she knows, she knows
How's it she knows?
She knows, she knows

Open your eyes

The useless drag of another day
The endless drags of a death rock boy
Mascara sure and lipstick lost
Glitter burned by restless thoughts
Of being forgotten

And in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Desperate and displeased
With whoever you are
And you're a star

Somewhere
He pulls his hair down over a frowning smile
A hidden diamond you cannot find
A secret star that cannot shine
Over to you
May the king of gloom
Be forever doomed

And in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Burning up in speed
Lost inside the dreams
Of teen machines

The useless drags, the empty days
The lonely towers of long mistakes
To forgotten faces and faded loves
Sitting still was never enough


And if you're giving in
Then you're giving up

'Cause in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Burning up in speed
Lost inside the dreams
Of teen machines

She didn't wanna be, she didn't wanna know
She couldn't run away 'cause she was crazy
She gave it all away, she saw her baby break
And in the air it hung that she was dull razors

And I said, "I wanna fill you up
I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
From one another, another one should come
To one another, no one should come between us"

Still, I was lonely, and she was by my side
My one and only knows that she could never hide
I couldn't feel her, and it was just a game
'Cause I was lonely and she was crazy

Rat-tat-tat! Ka boom boom!
Now take that, and just a bit of this
'Cause I'm a watcher, and I'm a doer of none
Come to save you, 'cause you're all mine

I hurt where I can't feel
I feel where I can't hurt
I know where I can't know
I bleed for me and mine

Ka-boom, a rat-tat-tat, and some good ole bliss
'Cause I'm a sister, and I'm a motherfuck

I am made of shamrocks
I am made of stern stuff
I am never enough
I am the forgotten child

And I said, "I wanna fill you up
I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
From one another, no one should ever come
In between us, between us and our love"

Mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went I was sure to go
Now Mary's got a problem, and Mary's not a stupid girl
Mary's got some deep shit, and Mary does not forget
And this is how Mary's garden grows
And this is how Mary has her ghosts

And in the eyes of the jackal I say ka-boom!

Now we begin descend to where we've never been
There is no going back, this wasn't meant to last
This is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve
And she will never learn, she will never learn

Bye bye, baby goodbye, bye bye
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I fear that I am ordinary just like everyone
To lie here and die among the sorrows
Adrift among the days
For everything I ever said
And everything I've ever done is gone
And dead

As all things must surely have to end
And great loves will one day have to part
I know that I am meant for this world

My life has been extraordinary
Blessed and cursed and won
Time heals but I'm forever broken
By and by the way
Have you ever heard the words
I'm singing in these songs?
It's for the girl I've loved all along
Can a taste of love be so wrong?

As all things must surely have to end
And great loves will one day have to part
I know that I am meant for this world

And in my mind as I was floating
Far above the clouds
Some children laughed I'd fall for certain
For thinking that I'd live forever

But I knew exactly where I was
And I knew the meaning of it all
And I knew the the distance to the sun
And I knew the echo that is love
And I knew the secrets in your spires
And I knew the emptiness of youth
And I knew the solitude of heart
And I knew the murmurs of the soul
And the world is drawn into your hands
And the world is etched upon your heart
And the world so hard to understand
Is the world you can't live without
And I knew the silence of the world

Ain't it
Funny
How we
Pretend we're still a child
Softly
Stolen
Under our blanket skies
And rescue me from me
And all that I believe

I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace
Here with you
Will you leave me too?

Carve out
Your heart
For keeps
In an old oak tree
And hold me
For goodbyes
And whispered lullabyes
And tell me I am still
The man I'm supposed to be

I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Will you leave me too
Will you leave me too?

Too late to turn back now
I'm running out of sound
And I am changing, changing
And if we died right now
This fool you love somehow
Is here with you

I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Would you leave me too?
Would you leave me too?

Bleed in your own light
Dream of your own life
I miss me
I miss everything I’ll never be
And on and on
I torch my soul to show
The world that I am pure
Deep inside my heart
No more lies
A crown of thorns
An image formed, behold
The mark I’ve borne
A mark of scorn to you
Consume my love, devour my hate
Only powers my escape
The moon is out, the stars invite
I think I’ll leave tonight
Soon, I’ll find myself alone
To relax and fade away
Do you know what’s coming down?
Do you know I couldn’t stay free?
I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free, free
Free of those voices inside me
I shall be free
I shall be free

Lover, lover, let’s pretend
We’re born as innocents
Cast into the world with apple eyes
To wish, wish dangerous
My dear delirious
To try and leave the rest of us behind

Shot full of diamonds
And a million years
The disappointed disappear
Like they were never here

Kiss, kiss all of this
The hiss that we had missed
And understand what can’t be understood
Sear those thoughts of me
Alone and unhappy
I never liked me anyway

If by chance
Or circumstance
We should fail
Don’t be so sad

Shot full of diamonds
And a million years
The disappointed disappear
Like they were never here

In a dream
We are connected
Siamese twins
At the wrist
And then I knew we’d been forsaken
Expelled from paradise
I can’t believe them
When they say that it’s alright


Words can’t define what I feel inside
Who needs them?
Caught with this virus of my mind
I give in to my disease, of my needs
To my disease, of my needs


She really loves to break
Her dad says it's OK
She really loves to break
And give it all away
Her ma says she’s afraid
What more can she fake?
She really needs to break
And give herself away

She gave it all away
She gave it all away
She gave it all away
We really love the USA

Quiet
I am sleeping
In here
We need a little hope
For years
I’ve been sleeping
Helpless
Couldn’t tell a soul

Be ashamed
Of the mess you’ve made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me

Silent
Metal mercies
Castrate
Boys to the bone
Jesus
Are you listening
Up there
To anyone at all?

We are the fossils
The relics of our time
We mutilate the meanings
So they’re easy to deny

Be ashamed
Of the mess you’ve made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me


Quiet
I am sleeping
Quiet
I am sleeping
Quiet
I don’t trust you
I can’t hear you

Be ashamed
Of the mess you’ve made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me

Behind me
The grace of falling snow
Cover up everything you know
Come save me from the awful sound
Of nothing

Sleep will not come to this tired body now
Peace will not come to this lonely heart

There are some things I'll live without
But I want you to know that I need you right now
I need you tonight

I steal a kiss from her sleeping shadow moves
'Cause I'll always miss her wherever she goes
And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me
I need someone to ease my mind
But sometimes a someone is so hard to find
And I'll do anything to keep her here tonight
And I'll say anything to make her feel alright
And I'll be anything to keep her here tonight
'Cause I want you to stay, with me
I need you tonight
She comes to me like an angel out of time
As I play the part of a saint on my knees

There are some things I'll live without
But I want you to know that I need you right now

Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire for you

I lie, I wait
I stop, I hesitate
I am, I breathe
I meant, I think of me

Is it any wonder I can't sleep?
All I have is all you gave to me
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?
Turn to the gates of heaven, to myself be damned
Turn away from light
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough

I taste, I love
I come, I bleed enough
I hate, I'm not
I was, I want too much

Is it any wonder I can't sleep?
All I have is all you gave to me
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?
Turn to the gates of heaven, to myself be damned
Turn away from light
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch
It's not enough, just a touch

Send a heartbeat to
The void that cries through you
Relive the pictures that have come to pass
For now we stand alone
The world is lost and blown
And we are flesh and blood disintegrate
With no more to hate

Is it bright where you are?
Have the people changed?
Does it make you happy you're so strange?
And in your darkest hour
I hold secrets flame
We can watch the world devoured in its pain

Delivered from the blast
The last of a line of lasts
The pale princess of a palace cracked
And now the kingdom comes
Crashing down undone
And I am a master of a nothing place
Of recoil and grace

Is it bright where you are?
Have the people changed?
Does it make you happy you're so strange?
And in your darkest hour
I hold secrets flame
We can watch the world devoured in its pain

Time has stopped before us
The sky cannot ignore us
No one can separate us
For we are all that is left
The echo bounces off me
The shadow lost beside me
There's no more need to pretend
Cause now I can begin again

Is it bright where you are?
Have the people changed?
Does it make you happy you're so strange?
And in your darkest hour
I hold secrets flame
We can watch the world devoured in its pain

Strange
Strange
Strange

You and me
Meant to be
Immutable
Impossible
It’s destiny
Pure lunacy
Incalculable
Inseparable

But for the last time
You’re everything
That I want and asked for
You’re all that I dream

Who wouldn’t be the one you love?
Who wouldn’t stand inside your love?
Protected and the lover of

A pure soul
And beautiful
You
Don’t understand
Don’t feel me now
I will breathe
For the both of us
Travel the world
Traverse the skies
Your home is here
Within my heart

And for the first time
I feel as though I am reborn
In my mind
Recast as child and mystic sage

Who wouldn’t be the one you love?
Who wouldn’t stand inside your love?


And for the first time
I’m telling you how much I need
And bleed for
Your every move and waking sound
In my time
I’ll wrap my wire around your heart
And you’re mine
You’re mine forever now

Who wouldn’t be the one you love and live for?
Who wouldn’t stand inside your love and die for?
Who wouldn’t be the one you love?

I'm never coming back
I'm never giving in
I'll never be the shine in your spit
I disconnect the act
I disconnect the dots
I disconnect the me in me

And you're mistaken, it's you that's faking
Living and breathing and dying too
This message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool
You can't bring me back, you can't bring me back
Cause I give it all back to you
Through sacred alleys, the living wrecks
Wreak their havoc upon this world
The disenchanted, the romantics
The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black hole

Destroy the mind-destroy the body-but you cannot destroy the heart
Destroy the mind-destroy the body-but you cannot destroy the heart
And you, you make me so I need to disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love to disconnect
To runaround kids in get-go cars
With Vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs
Galaxies full of nobodies
Giving us the farewell runarounds
I took a Virgin Mary ax to his sweet baby Jane
Lost my innocence to a no good girl
Scratch my face with anvil hands
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth
And I give it all back to you
I give it all back to you, yeah
I give it all back to you
For you

No way
I don't need it
I don't need your love
Disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love
Disconnect

No way, no way, no way
Disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love
Disconnect
No way, no way, no way
Disconnect
Yeah

Twilight fades
Through blistered avalon
The sky’s cruel torch
On aching autobahn
Into the uncertain divine
We scream into the last divide

You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me real

Sheila rides on
Crashing nightingale
Intake eyes leave passing vapor trails
With blushing brilliance alive
Because it’s time to arrive

You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me real

Lately, I just can’t seem to believe
Discard my friends to change the scenery
It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
But now, it’s just a matter of grace

A summer storm
Graces all of me
Highway warm
Sing silent poetry
And I could bring you the light
And take you home into the night

You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me real
Lately, I just can't seem to believe
Discard my friends to change the scenery
It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
But now, it's just a matter of grace

Cast the pearls aside
Of a simple life of need
Come into my life forever
The crumbled cities stand as known
Of the sights you have been shown
Of the hurt you call your own
You know, you know

Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide

The empty bodies stand at rest
Casualties of their own flesh
Afflicted by their dispossession

But no bodies ever knew
No bodies
No bodies felt like you
No bodies

Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is

Now we drive the night, to the ironies of peace
You can't help deny forever
The tragedies reside in you
The secret sights hide in you
The lonely nights divide you in two
In two, in two
All my blisters now revealed
In the darkness of my dreams
In the spaces in between us

No bodies ever knew
Nobody
No bodies felt like you
No bodies
No bodies ever knew
Nobody
No bodies felt like you
Nobody

Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide

No matter where you are
I can still hear you when you drown
You've traveled very far
Just to see you I'll come around
When I'm down
All of those yesterdays
Coming down

No matter where you are
I can still hear you when you dream
You traveled very far
You traveled far, like a star
And you are
All of those yesterdays
Coming down

Is it something someone said?
Was it something someone said?


Yesterday the sky was you
And I still feel the same
Nothing left for me to do
And I still feel the same

I wish, I wish I could fly
I wish, I wish I could lie
I will, I will try
I will, I will
Goodbye

I hear your winter
I hear your rain
And I’ve failed your summer ways
And I feel no pain

I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way


I hear you fade away
And I hear you crawl
I gave my life away
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel your pain

And she was my lover, so sweet
And she was my angel
And what I’ve recovered of me
I put into a box underneath my bed

When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
Lie
Lie

Bang, bang, you’re dead, hole in your head
Bang, bang, you’re dead, hole in your head
Bang, bang, you’re dead, hole in your head
Bang, bang, you’re dead, hole in your head

I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way

To my mistakes
To my mistakes of cowardice
She shimmy shakes
The jimmy jakes of consequence
Born of the airs and dues
My airs of madness do declare
That it's okay
It's love

It's what you wanted to see
It's who you wanted to be
For what you needed to need
She'll make it up
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love

Machine gun blues
Her vacant rush is so steel
I'm unaware
Lost inside your visions
I got mine too over
I got mine and I got you
'Cause I know you
You're love

It's what you wanted to see
It's who you wanted to be
For what you needed to need
She'll make it up
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love
It's who you know
Love, love

And when I lost my mind
I knew I was in for a long night

Can I look up to you as you look down on me
Can I feel in to you as you felt in to me
I can't help what you see, I can't help but to be
For what you needed to need, she'll make it
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love, it's who you know
Love, love
Love solves everything...but love

Cupid hath pulled back his sweetheart's bow
To cast divine arrows into her soul
To grab her attention swift and quick
Or morrow the marrow of her bones be thick
With turpentine kisses and mistaken blows

See the Devil may do as the Devil may care
He loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare
Her mouth the mischief he doth seek
Her heart the captive of which he speaks
So note all ye lovers in love with the sound
Your world be shattered with nary a note
Of one Cupid's arrow under your coat

And in the land of star crossed lovers
And barren hearted wanderers
Forever lost in forsaken missives and Satan's pull
We seek the unseekable and we speak the unspeakable
Our hopes dead gathering dust to dust
In faith, in compassion, and in love

Goodnight, to every little hour that you sleep tight
May it hold you through the winter of a long night
And keep you from the loneliness of yourself

Heart strung is your heart frayed and empty
Cause it's hard luck, when no one understands your love
It's unsung, and I say

Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart

Goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your
Head light with the wishes of a Sandman and a
Night light, be careful not to let the bedbugs
Sleep tight nestled in the covers

The sun shines but I don't
A silver rain will wash away

The sun shines but I don't
A silver rain will wash away

And you can tell, it's just as well
And you can tell, it's just as well

Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart

Wrap me up in always, and drag me in with maybes
Your innocence is treasure, your innocence is death
Your innocence is all I have
Breathing underwater, and living under glass

If you spin your love around
The secrets of your dreams
You may find your love is gone
And is not quite what it seemed
To appear to disappear
Beneath all your darkest fears

I believe in never, I believe in all the way
But belief is not to notice, believe is just some faith
And faith can't help you to escape
And with this ring I wed thee true
And with this ring I wed thee now
And with this ring I play so dead
But no one's asking for the truth, so let me tell you

If you spin your love around
The secrets of your dreams
You may find your love is gone
And is not quite what it seemed
To appear to disappear
Beneath all your darkest fears

To the revelations of fresh faced youth
No one will come to save you
So speak your peace in the murmurs drawn
But youth is wasted on the young

Your strength is my weakness, your weakness my hate
My love for you just can't explain
Why we're forever frozen, forever beautiful
Forever lost inside ourselves

The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold
Us
Young

Welcome to nowhere fast
Nothing here ever lasts
Nothing but memories
Of what never was

We're nowhere, we're nowhere, we're nowhere to be
Nowhere, we're nowhere, we're nowhere to see
To see

Living makes me sick
So sick I wish I'd die
Down in the belly of the beast
I can't lie

You're nowhere, you're nowhere, you're nowhere to be
Nowhere, you're nowhere, you're nowhere to see
To see

There's nothing left to do
There's nothing left to feel
Doesn't matter what you want, so

To make yourself feel better
You make it so you'll never
Give in to your forevers
And live for always

And ever, forever, you're forever to be
Forever, forever, you're forever to me
To me
You

By starlight I'll kiss you
And promise to be your one and only
I'll make you feel happy
And leave you to be lost in mine
And where will we go, what will we do?
Soon said I, we'll know

And are you just like me?
Dead eyes, Dead eyes, are you just like me?
Her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas yeah
Dead eyes, Dead eyes, are you just like me?

And all along, we knew we'd carry on
Just to belong

By starlight I know you
As lovely as a wish granted true
My life has been empty, my life has been untrue
And does she really know, who I really am?
Does she really know me at last?

And are you just like me?
Dead eyes, are you just like me?
Her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas yeah
Dead eyes, Dead eyes, are you just like me?
And are you just like me?
And are you just like me?

As far as you take me
That's where I believe
The realm of soft delusions
Floating on the leaves
On a distant shoreline
She waves her arms to me
As all the thought police
Are closing in for sleep
The dilly dally
Of my bright lit stay
The steam of my misfortunes
Has given me the power to be afraid
And in my mind I'm everyone
And in my mind

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right
Porcelina of the oceans blue
Porcelina
Porcelina

In the slipstream
Of thoughtless thoughts
The light of all that's good
The light of all that's true
To the fringes gladly
I walk unadorned
With gods and their creations
With filth and disease
Porcelina
She waits for me there
With seashell hissing lullabyes
And whispers fathomed deep inside my own
Hidden thoughts and alibis
My secret thoughts come alive

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right

And in my mind I'm everyone
In my mind I'm everyone
In my mind I'm everyone of you
You make it right
It's all alright
You make it right
Porcelina of the oceans blue
Porcelina of the oceans blue

We only come out at night; we only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night

And once again, you'll pretend to know me well, my friends
And once again, I'll pretend to know the way
Through the empty space
Through the secret places of the heart

We only come out at night; we only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night

I walk alone, I walk alone to find the way home
I'm on my own, I'm on my own to see the ways
That I can't help the days, you will make it home OK
I know you can, and you can

We only come out at night; we only come out at night
The days are much too bright
We only come out at night

And once again, you'll pretend to know that
That there's an end, that there's an end to this begin
It will help you sleep at night
It will make it seem that right is always right
Alright?

We only come out at night; we only come out at night
The days are much too bright

Boredom's in the bathroom shaking out the loose teeth
Sally's in the stirrups claiming her destiny
And nobody nowhere understands anything
About me and all my dreams
Lost at sea
Jack it up Judy set your heart alight
Mayfair mistress of the satellites
Misspent youth - faking up a rampage
To hold off the real slaves
Paid off and staid

And what you never knew
Can never get to you
So fake it
I'll be your Stumbleine
I'll be your super queen
And make you

Jukebox fuckup hanging round the drugstore
No matter what you say he'll be back for more
Mommy's in the manger with the little kids
She's got her reasons, got my forgets
Of tears and idle threats
Misplaced

And no matter what they do
They can't get to you
So fake it
I'll be your stumbleine
I'll be your super queen
And make you me

Come around Ruby I could never sleep alone

I took my love and took it down
I climbed a mountain, i turned around
And I saw my reflection in a snow covered hill
'til the landslide brought it down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changing cause I've
Built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older, too


Well, I've been afraid of changing cause I've
Built my life around you

Even children get older

Take me down, to the underground
Won't you take me down, to the underground
Why oh why, there is no light
And if I can't sleep, can you hold my life
And all I see is you

Take my hand, I lost where I began
In my heart I know all of my faults
Will you help me understand
And I believe in you
You're the other half of me
Soothe and heal...
When you sleep, when you dream
I'll be there if you need me, whenever I hear you sing

There is a sun, it'll come, the sun, I hear them call me down
I held you once, a love that once, and life had just begun
And you're all I see...
And trumpets blew, and angels flew on the other side, dear
And you're all I see, and you're all I'll need
There's a love that God puts in your heart

Lily, my one and only
I can hardly wait till I see her
Silly, I know I'm silly
Cause I'm hanging in this tree
In the hopes that she will catch a glimpse of me

And thru her window shade
I watch her shadow move
I wonder if she...

Lily, my one and only
Love is in my heart and in your eyes
Will she or won't she want him
No one knows for sure
But an officer is knocking at my door

And thru her window shade
I watch her shadow move
I wonder if she could only see me

And when I'm with her I feel fine
If I could kiss her I wouldn't mind the time it took to find
My Lily, my one and only
I can hardly wait till I see her
Oh Lily, I know you love me
Cause as they're draggin' me away
I swear I saw her raise her hand and wave (goodbye)

Pop Tart, what’s our mission?
Do we know but never listen?
For too long they held me under
But I hear it’s almost over
In Detroit on a Memphis train
Like you said, it’s down in the heat and the summer rain
The automatic gauze of your memories
Down in the sleep at the airplane races
Try to hold on to this heart a little bit longer
Try to hold on to this love aloud
Try to hold on, for this heart’s a little bit colder
Try to hold on to this love
Paperback scrawl your hidden poems
Written around the dried out flowers
Here we are, still trading places
Try to hold on
Pop Tart, can you envision
A free world of clear division?
For too long they held us under
But I know we’re getting over
In Detroit with the Nashville tears
Like you said, it’s down in the heat with the broken numbers
Down in the gaze of solemnity
Down in the way you’ve held together
Try to hold on to this heart a little bit closer
Try to hold on to this love aloud
Try to hold on, for this heart’s a little bit older
Try to hold on to this love aloud
And we are still alive
Try to hold on
And we have survived
Try to hold on
And no one should deny
We tried to hold onto the pulse of the feedback current
Into the flow of encrypted movement
Slapback kills the ancient remnants
That try to hold on
Try to hold on to this heart alive
Try to hold on to this heart aloud
Try to hold on
And we are still alive
Try to hold on
And we have survived
Try to hold on
Pop Tart, you never listen
Skinned knees
Try to hold on
Stop start, what’s our mission?
Skinned knees
Try to hold on

Candy cane walks down
To build a bonfire, to break my fall
My baby, my sweet thing
Just maybe we could lose ourselves this time
King of the horseflies, dark prince of death
His tragic forces are heaven sent
In sweet things, in a lovers breath
In knowing this was meant to be the last
A go-go-go-kids, a go-go-go-style
A suck suck suck kiss, a suck suck suck smile
As always, in young need
A veiled promise to never die
On dead highways, her black beauties roam
For June angels, so far from home
For a love lost, a faded picture
To tread lightning, to ink the lavender skies

Get on get on get on the bomb
Get back get back where you belong
Get on get on get on the bomb
Get back get back where you belong
Get on
The bomb

You know I’m not dead
You know I’m, you know I’m not dead
You know I’m not dead
You know I’m not dead

Now you know
Where I’ve been
As you sleep
Torn I am
Weighted down
Patiently
Born of love

You know I’m, you know I’m not dead
I’m just living in my head
Forever waiting
On the ways of your desire
You always find a way
And through it all
Into us all you move
Forgotten touch
Forbidden thought
We can never have enough

You know I’m not dead
You know I’m, you know I’m not dead
You know I’m not dead

Found below
The creatures scream
Stranglehold
A god machine
Begging to
Tear us out
What is hell

You know I’m, you know I’m not dead
I’m just the tears inside your head
Forever waiting
On the ways of your desire
You always find a way
And through it all
Into us all you move
Forgotten touch
Forbidden thought
We can never have enough
You know I’m not dead

We all want to hold in the everlasting gaze
Enchanted in the rapture of his sentimental sway
But underneath the wheels lie the skulls of every cog
The fickle fascination of an everlasting god

You know I’m not dead
I’m just living in my head
Forever waiting
Forever waiting a cruel death
You know I’m not dead
I’m just living for myself
Forever waiting

You know I’m not dead
You know I’m not dead
You know I’m not dead
You know I’m not dead

I spin off and lose my head
Throwing stray, a spark instead
Gather strength down in my heel
And dig it in the world I peel

Way down deep within my heart
Lies a soul that’s torn apart
Tell me, tell me what you’re after
I just want to get there faster

I don’t live – I inhale
I don’t give – I unveil
Don’t want to live in your misery
I don’t live – I inhale

Sprinkle all my kisses on your head
Stars full of wishes fill our beds
She said, "I’m dead."


All this pain smothers me
Like a bomb that you can’t see
Tell me, tell me what you’re after
I just want to get there faster
Yeah!

I don’t live – I inhale
I don’t give – I unveil
I don’t live – I inhale
I don’t live

Beautiful, you're beautiful, as beautiful as the sun
Wonderful, you're wonderful, as wonderful as they come
And I can't help but feel attached
To the feelings I can't even match
With my face pressed up to the glass, wanting you
Beautiful, you're beautiful, as beautiful as the sky
Wonderful, it's wonderful, to know that you're just like I

And I'm sure you know me well
As I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell
Who you love and who you won't
No, no
Who you love and who you won't

And I love you, as you love me
Na na na na na na na na
So let the clouds roll by your face
We'll let the world spin on to another place
We'll climb the tallest tree above it all
To look down on you and me
And them

And I'm sure you know me well
As I'm sure you don't
But you just can't tell
Who you love and who you won't
No, no
Who you love and who you won't
No, no
Who you love and who you won't
No, no

Don't let your life wrap up around you
Don't forget to call, whenever
I'll be here just waiting for you
I'll be under your stars forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you
I'll be under the stairs forever
Neither here nor there just right beside you...

The sewers belch me up
The heavens spit me out
From ethers tragic I am born again
And now I'm with you now
Inside your world of woe
To move in desires made of deadly pretends
Until the end times begin

Is it bright where you are?
Have the people changed?
Does it make you happy you're so strange?
And in your darkest hour
I hold secrets' flame
You can watch the world devoured in its pain
Strange

Climb my ribcage to
The replays run for you
Unhook my lights to peek behind the flash
For I am crystal chrome
I am shatter dome
I am kremlin king of angels avenged
To destroy the end

Is it bright where you are?
Have the people changed?
Does it make you happy you're so strange?
And in your darkest hour
I hold secrets' flame
You can watch the world devoured in its pain
Strange

The zeppelins rain upon us
The guns of love disastrous
A shadow lies amongst you
To defy the future cast

Is it bright where you are?
Have the people changed?
Does it make you happy you're so strange?
And in your darkest hour
I hold secrets' flame
You can watch the world devoured in its pain
Strange

I am one as you are three
Try to find a messiah in your trinity
Your city to burn, your city to burn
Try to look for something in your city to burn
You’ll burn
Am I as I seem?
I’m down
Down
So down
Time is right for a guiding light
Try to turn to reasons in your bitter life
Your city to burn, your city to burn
Try to look for something in your city to burn
You’ll burn
See you, don’t you just want to
See you, I am one
See you, don’t you just want to
See you

See you, don’t you just want to
See you, I am one
See you, don’t you just want to
See you, I am one

I don't love you
For what it's worth
So if you're leaving
Can you hurt?
Cherry blossom
This is goodbye
Come here lately
And you'll fly

When they say
What it's worth
The world tells you first
And you know
Where to hurt

The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?
Lover let me please
Fall on down your knees
Lover let me please
Be the one
Know the prayers to make
For lovers made to fade
(lovers made to fade)
And when you swore to wait and only burst
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?

Yes I loved you
As a matter of fact
Your furs are wrapped up
And that's that

Lover let me please
Fall onto your knees
You once made me smile
Then you strayed
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?

Lover have you breached?
To make for your release?
(To make for your release)
So I'll no longer err by your side
What's to hide?

The world's on fire
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Monday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Tuesday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Wednesday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Thursday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Friday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Saturday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Sunday

Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet little agony
I don’t know just where you’ve been
But I’ll take, take, take
All that you have for me, in sin
Where are we going?

And they all want you to change
And they all want you to change

And the sad, sad, sad
All the sad faces drown, in this town
Where are we going?

And they all want you to change
(Where are we going?)
And they all want you to change
(Where are we going?)

Whenever I run
Wherever I run to you, lost one
It’s never done
Just hanging on
The past has let me be
Returning as a dream
Shattered as belief
If you have to go, don’t say goodbye
If you have to go, don’t you cry
If you have to go, I will get by
Someday, I’ll follow you and see you on the other side
But for the grace of love
I’d will the meaning of
Heaven from above
But for the grace of love
I’d will the meaning of
Heaven from above
Your picture out of time
Left aching in my mind
Shadows kept alive
If you have to go, don’t say goodbye
If you have to go, don’t you cry
If you have to go, I will get by
I will follow you and see you on the other side
But for the grace of love
I’d will the meaning of
Heaven from above
But for the grace of love
I’d will the meaning of
Heaven from above
Long horses we are born
Creatures more than torn
Mourning our way home

It's all I wanted
It's all I could see
You can watch me bleed
Daylight comes and washes over me
Take what you have wanted
This is not your promise to me
And there's someone beside you
What they want isn't what they see, see
Feel it in your heart
In the morning I could see
It's all I wanted
It's all I could see
And there's something inside you
Daylight comes and washes over me
Feel it in your heart
In the morning I could see
Feel it in your heart
In the morning I could see
One and two is three

Farewell, goodnight, last one out turn out the lights
And let me be, let me die inside
Let me know the way through this world of hate in you
'Cause the die is cast and the bitch is back
And we're all dead, yeah, we're all dead

Inside the future of a shattered past
I lie just to be real, and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
Because beyond my hopes, there are no feelings

Bless the martyrs and kiss the kids
For knowing better, for knowing this
'Cause you're all whores and I'm a fag
And I've got no mother and I've got no dad

To save me from the wasted, save me from myself
I lie just to be real, and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
Because beyond my hopes there are no feelings

If I believe, if I deceive, if I defend you now that way
Would you believe, could you recieve, could you have faith?
No one is, is ever gone
And time is everything and I have none

Everybody's lost just waiting to be found
Everyone's a thought just waiting to fade
So fuck it all, 'cause I don't care
So what somehow somewhere we dared

To try to dare, to dare for a little more
I lie just to be real, and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
Because beyond my hopes, there are no feelings

I really don't want to look stupid when I'm sleeping
I never really liked sunny days
The black wings just reach out to me over the distance
I can feel the wind from the wings
I see the clouds and I feel the ocean with my feet
I know I'm home
It requires an ablity to judge distance
The aeroplane flies high
Turns left, looks right

Love is a sentimental heart
Life is a sentimental way
Spy the fragile heart so cursed
As he walks across this earth

I'm disconnected by your smile
Disconnect a million miles
And what you promised me
I hope will set you free
I'm disconnected by your smile

If I knew where I was going, I would already be there
Ha-ha-ha I don't know
I wish I had more time
Judicial, beautiful, ahh, ormentive whatever
I've always been afraid to die but I think I'm more afraid to live

And all I gave to you is lust
And all you took from me is lust
Black wings carry me so high
Up to meet you in the sky

I'm disconnected by your smile
Disconnect a million miles
And what you promised me
I hope will set you free
I'm disconnected by your smile

I'm disconnected by your smile
Disconnect a million miles
And what you promised me
I hope will set you free
I'm disconnected by your smile

Wishing you were real to me
Wishing I could make believe
I'll take my secrets to the grave
Safely held beneath the waves
Always knew I couldn't save
Always knew I couldn't save you

And in my heart I know you there
And in my heart I know you care
And in my heart I know you're gone

All your seven dreams
Are closer than you believe
As your things come undone
See you are the only one
Flower, seize the hour the day away
Waiting, waiting for your way away
When you wake up your own way
Throwing your life away
Softly siren coming home
Siren snail
It's what you wait for
Flower, the pain will wash away, away
When the sun shines
And climbs through your window
Into your bed
When you wake up your own way
Throwing your life away
Softly siren coming home
Siren snail
Yeah, that's my home
Flower, save the hours
Flower, away
It's what you wait for
Flower, chase the sunshine
Flower, chase the sunshine
Flower

My daydream seems as one inside of you
Though it seems hard to reach through this life
Your blue and hopeless life
My daydream screams bitter ’til the end
The love I share -true- selfish to the heart
My heart, my sacred heart
My daydream dream
My daydream
My daydream dream
My daydream
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
You wrap your arms around
A feeling that surrounds
Like liquid peppermint
Just taste the dreams that she sent

And this feeling shivers down your spine
Love comes in colors, I can't deny
All that matters is love, love, your love

You're sleeping in your bed
Just rest your weary head
Maybe you shouldn't care
Throw away those dreams and dares

And I wonder if it matters to me
Love comes in colors, I can't deny
All that shimmers is love, love, your love
Your love
Your love

Blew, blew, blew away
But I don't wanna fade
Blew, blew, blew

And if you love her
You know it will come true
And if you need her
You know that she'll be there
Stay awake, I lie here
With her and I fall
When I wake inside you
I know you know I'm yours

Blew, blew, blew away
But i don't wanna fade
Blew, blew, blew

And if you're sad, too
Until the angel sings and touches you
Don't confuse my only life
I said blew, and please don't ever leave
I will grieve, and 'member thee
Hope to meet you there


And I wanna let her know
That I won't let her go
I wanna let her know
That I love her so

I'm blew, blew, blew, blew away
But I don't wanna--
Blew, I love you
Blew, blew

Bury me in love
Bury me in blood
Shield your kisses
Take your heart
Bury me if it hurts

I love my sister so
Chain, unchain
She don't smother me
Chain, unchain, unchain
I breathe in spades I know
Unchain
I'm a jack of all trades
Won't you bury me?

Want to see her born inside
Hide, hide
Some are things you just can't hide
If you see her tell me why
Hide, hide
Why won't she come outside


If you see her tell me why
Hide, hide
Why won't she come outside
Want to see her born inside
Hide, hide
Some are things you just can't hide


She waits, bury me
She waits, bury me

We dismiss
The backroads
And ride these streets
Unafraid
Resigned to
Scraping paint
From our bones
Unashamed
No more the eye upon you
No more the simple man

Desolation yes, hesitation no
Desolation yes, hesitation no
As you might have guessed all is never shown
Desolation yes hesitation no

And in my prayers
I dream alone
A silent speech
To deaf ear
If you want love
You must be love
But if you bleed love
You will die love
No more the lie upon you
Cast in stone and autumn shade

Desolation yes
Hesitation no
Desolation yes
Hesitation no
As you might have sensed
We won't make it home
Desolation yes
Hesitation no

Before the rites of spring
Come to mean all things
A little taste of what may come
A mere glimpse of what has gone
Cause for the moment we are free
We seek to bind our release
Too young to die, too rich to care
Too fucked to swear that I was there

Desolation yes
Hesitation no
Desolation yes
Hesitation no
As you might have guessed we won't make it home
Desolation yes
Hesitation no

With the sugar sickness
You spy the kidnap kid
Who kids you to oblivion
It’s the perfect hassle
For the perfumed kiss
He makes you miss him more than home

You love him
You love him more than this
You love him and you cannot, you can’t resist
You love him
You love him for yourself
You love him and no one, no one else

Past sidewalk ashes
A last lovers' arc
You come apart to intertwine
It was all so simple
As you watched him move
Across the darkness in your room

You love him
You love him for yourself
You love him and no one, no one else

Into the winding vines
The pretty boys dive
And through the pinhole stars
Into the shadow mind
Will you lose him then
On some gentle dawn?
This boy is here and gone

You love him
You love him for yourself
You love him and no one, no one else
You love him
You love him more than this
You love him and you cannot, you can’t resist

You love him
You love him
You love him
You love him
You love him
You love him
You love him
You love him
You love him
You love him…

Who am I to need you when I’m down?
And where are you when I need you around?
Your life is not your own
And all I ask you
Is for another chance
Another way around you
To live by circumstance, once again
Who am I to need you now?
To ask you why?
To tell you no?
To deserve your love and sympathy?
You were never meant to belong to me
And you may go, but I know you won’t leave
Too many years built into memories
Your life is not your own
Who am I to need you now?
To ask you why?
To tell you no?
To deserve your love and sympathy?
You were never meant to belong to me
Who am I to you?
Along the way
I lost my faith
And as you were
You’ll be again
To mold like clay
To break like dirt
To tear me up in your sympathy
You were never meant to belong to me
You were never meant to belong to me
You were never meant to belong to me
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?

The lights came on fast
Lost in motor crash
Gone in a flash, unreal
But you knew all along
You laugh the light
I sing the songs
To watch you numb
I saw you there
You were on your way
You held the rain
And for the first time
Heaven seemed insane
'Cause heaven is to blame
For taking you away
Do you know the way that I can?
Do you know the way that I can't lose?
Do you know the things that I can?
Do you know the things that I can do?
Where is your heart?
Where is your heart gone to?
Tear me apart
Tear me apart from you
You laugh the light
I cry the wound
In gray afternoons
I saw you there
You were on your way
You kissed me cold
And for the first time
Heaven seemed insane
For taking you away
'Cause heaven is to blame
For taking you away
The lights came to pass
Dead opera motor crash
Gone in a flash, unreal
In nitrous, overcast
Do you know the way that I can?
Do you know the way that I can’t choose?
Do you know the things that I can?
Do you know the things that I can’t lose?
Tear me apart
Tear me apart from you
Where is your heart?
Where has your heart run to?

A serpent for your fist
And a scarab for your mouth
The symptoms say persist
So resist
But a cure is not in doubt

I'm gonna fly forever

When doldrums age in platinum
I've a starship you can use

Mother, I’m tired
Come surrender, my son
Time has ravaged on my soul
No plans to leave but still, I go
Fallin’ with the leaves
Fallin’ out of sleep
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?
Mother, I’ve tried
Wasting my life
"I haven’t given up," I lie
To make you so proud in my eyes
Fallin’ out of sleep
Crawlin’ over me
To the last goodbyes
Who cares why?
Tuesday's come and gone
Restless, still, I drive
Try to leave it all behind
Fallin’ out of sleep
Fallin’ with the leaves
I go crawlin’ over me
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
Once upon a time in my life
I went falling
I went falling
Mother, I hope you know
That I miss you so
Time has ravaged on my soul
To wipe a mother's tears grown cold

17 seconds to trust you again
17 seconds of radiance
17 seconds to send a prayer up
17 seconds is all you really need

Blank page is all the rage
Never meant to say anything
In bed, I was half dead
Tired of dreaming of rest
Got dressed, drove the state line
Looking for you at the five and dime
Stop sign told me, "stay at home"
Told me you were not alone
Blank page was all the rage
Never meant to hurt anyone
In bed, I was half dead
Tired of dreaming of rest
You haven’t changed
You’re still the same
May you rise as you fall
You were easy, you are forgotten
You are the ways of my mistakes
I catch the rainfall
Through the leaking roof
That you had left behind
You remind me, of that leak in my soul
The rain falls, my friends call
Leaking rain on the phone
Take a day, plant some trees
May they shade you from me
May your children play beneath
Blank page was all the rage
Never meant to say anything
In bed, I was half dead
Tired of dreaming of rest
Got dressed, drove the state line
Looking for you at the five and dime
But there I was, picking pieces up
You are a ghost, of my indecision
No more, little girl

You should know that I love you
We should love like lovers do
And I can't help but fall for you
Ah honey I'm just a fool
Now you know
Darling, I'll never be true
You see, for so long I was blue
I'm not the only one
And if I hurt, then you will, too
Ah honey I always lose
Now you know
Lover, when will you?
I'm so afraid that no one cares
Lover, can't find you
I swear to God don't leave me here
Now you know
Oh, you know that it can't be
But no one else here really means
Anything to me
If you hurt inside
If you confide in me again
Since you ran away
Hold me now, tell me how
Love is ours
Lover, when will you?
I'm so afraid that no one cares
Lover, can't find you
And no one knows what brings us here
Lover
Hold me now
Hold me now
Tell me how
Love is ours

I don't look in the mirror
I don't like what I see staring back at me
Everything is clearer, I'll never see what you see
It's not me, so beautiful and free
I'll never be what you need
Can't help it at all
I was born so beautiful, but now I'm ugly
And I rot in my skin, as a piece of me dies everyday
I know I'm nothing, I know there's nothing I can say
To change the judgement in their ways
I'll never be what you need
Can't help it at all
My love was so beautiful, but now I'm ugly
Yeah..

I'm good enough, but I don't care
I'm good enough, but I'm not there
I'm good enough, but I don't care
The sun is out, but I'm not there
I'm good enough, but I don't care
The sun is out, but I'm not there
I'm good enough, I'm good enough

I don't look in the mirror
I don't like what I see staring back at me
Everything is clearer, I'll never see what you see
And I rot in my skin, as a piece of me dies everyday
I know I'm nothing, because I'm ugly..

Struggle to renew
Blurry mind, so hypnotized

I won’t believe in you
Hang on to your life

I love you true
Surely I do

And the embers never fade
In my city by the lake
The place where I was born
As the wind-up toys wind down
Muffling the sound
Of a life hidden underground
Believe, believe in me
Believe
That you can change, that you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same, we're different
Tonight
Tonight, tonight
We'll the crucify the insincere tonight
We'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonight
The impossible is possible tonight
Believe in me like I believe in you tonight

Kiss and kill me sweetly
Come and drive me home
Drag the miles in me
I am yours alone

Inside, where it’s warm
Wrap myself in you
Outside, where I’m torn
Fight myself in two
In two
Into you

Desire me so deeply
Drain and kick me hard
Whisper secrets for me
Try to go too far

Inside, where it’s warm
Wrap myself in you
Outside, where I’m torn
Fight myself in two
In two
Into…

Please, don’t change
Please, don’t change at all
Bring your rain
Bring your rain to fall

Inside, where it’s warm
Wrap myself in you
Outside, where I’m torn
Fight myself in two
In two
Into you

Come and kiss me sweetly
(Kiss kiss)
Ride the telephone
(Kiss kiss)
Drag the miles to me
(Kiss kiss)
I am yours alone
(Kiss kiss)
Yours alone
Yours alone
On the telephone
Yours alone
Looking for a kiss, kiss
Yours alone

All that you suffer is all that you are
All that you smother is all that you are
And you’re seeing, you’re seeing, you’re seeing who you are
What takes meaning is cleaning the meaning of who you are
On this seam
I will dream
On this seam
All of you struggles beneath your disguise
Drink from the reasons that hold you alive
To ascend from the wounds of desire and pain
You must rise from the mounds of desire and change
Too late to discover peace of mind
Too late to recover me
All you see and all you breathe and
All you cease to be
Taking down your only son and
What he means to me
Your dream will be
To dream with me
Will you wait? Yes, I'll wait
I will wait for you
Will you wait? Yes, I'll wait
I will wait for you
To cleanse your life
Takes more than time
Take what you want
Take all of me
Too late to discover
Peace of mind (I've no peace of mind)
Too late to recover

Amphetamine Annie-Dog
Has her leash and a face
Her velvet spleen
Her shackle spine
Her diamond curse
It comes with mine
A vessel she for violent I
Confession arms a wake
Mine, mine, you were always mine
Possessed by my taste
And below, the angel dog
Combs her hair and sings her psalms
The bombs go off, she doesn’t notice
It all goes wrong, she sets things tragic
She is Venus, she is Mars
She’s electric, and the struggle of
Upon her face, we leave no trace
But in her stomach, mercury aged
She holds the blood
She carves the knives
She tapes the wires in our babies
Amphetamine Annie-Dog
Pulls her trash and her stories
From place to place, and bed to bed
Gives of herself and the magnet head
Another floor, another ceiling
Counting stars with double meanings
Is it wrong to be swallowed whole?
To disappear in her?
To give to her the priceless peace
Of giving up control?
We tumble out into the streets
And Annie-Dog, she drags her leash
Pretty face, ugly mouth
Bitter bred and so released
And by the no, and in the yes
Annie goes, if you couldn’t guess
A simple man, a sycophant
Her elephant with the laughing call
She wants clean sheets, and fresh flowers
And dental shots, and the Hong Kong glue
Amphetamine Annie-Dog
Has her leash and a face

Hungry, hungry again
Hungry, hungry again
When will it start to sway
When will it start to almost break you
Hungry, hungry again
Hungry, hungry again
I'll miss you
I don't wish you hurt
I forgive you
I don't wish you away, away, away
It'll almost break you
Almost take you
Almost break you
Almost break you up

Close your eyes
Until the sunlight dies
In your head a thousand stars
Through the darkness you can see a light
And if they steal your life
Your heart is still mine
I want to believe in you and I heard you
Your song, you sing, a truth, there's no other
I want to believe in you, dear
On Sunday
There's a life I hide
Well I tried to disguise
And I can take you a million miles away
I want to believe in you and I heard you
Your song, you sing, a truth, there's no other
I want to believe in you, dear
On Sunday I made amends
For all my mistakes
May God speed be with you
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And I, I want to believe in you and I heard you
Your song, you sing a truth, there's no other
I want to believe in you and I heard you
Your song, you sing a truth, there's no other
I want to believe in you and I heard you
Your song, (soft) you sing, a truth, a lover
I want to believe in you and I heard you
Your song, you sing a truth, there's no other
I want to believe in you, dear
Sunday
Sunday
I want to make amends
For all my mistakes
May God speed be with you

Fuss my love, don't fight
Never leave here this night
Words, pray? Dull fame
For what is love if love obeys?
Let flee doves in flight
May we stray from our right
And ever leave here softly

I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
Your pyres of wonder can't say what it means
And still I love you, and like everything
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes

If you break, believe me
If you take, deceive me
To the sound of one clapping hand
Is your heart so lonely
That your honor is only
As good as can be bound on command
Hush my love, don't fight
Never leave here this night

I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
Your pyres of wonder can't say what it means
And still I love you, and like everything
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes

I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes

I don't want to fight
Every single night
Everything I want is in your eyes
You and me go back
To places I don't know to care
The spoils of all I got were left for scraps
Don't let me say this
But you're no worse than me
It's crazy
We are the real
If real ever was
And just because
We are the real
They feel we have enough
We are the real
'Cause someone gave us up
I want to be there when you're happy
I want to love you when you're sad
Can't stand the morning rain?
Get out, I'll take your place then
Can't stand the blazing sun?
Then close your eyes you'll see
The angel dust
I don't want to be
Anything believed
A million watts of sound can't compare
Come along you'll see the world
The pulse ripples, the crowd unfurls
The current starts to flow and then you're on
Oh it's white hot soul they want
To sing for
We are the real
If real ever was
And just because
We are the ruin
Of every living soul
We are surreal
'Cause someone gave us up
Don't break the oath
I want to love you when you're happy
Don't break this oath
I want to be there when you're sad
Freeze-frame the pouring rain
We are the real
As real as any ghost
So easy now
We are the real
In ever living soul
Oh don't they know?
Can't stand the blazing sun?
Can't stand the morning rain?
Oh get out I'll take your place again
I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be alone at all
If it's a white hot soul they want
Then a black heart they'll get

I’ve faced the fathoms in your deep
Withstood the suitor's quiet siege
Pulled down the heavens just to please you
Appease you
The wind blows and I know
I can’t go on
Digging roses from your grave
To linger on
Beyond the beyond
Where the willows weep
And the whirlpools sleep
You’ll find me
The coarse tide reflects sky
And the night mare rides on
And the night mare rides on
With a December black psalm
And the night mare rides on
What I fear is lost here
The wind blows and I know
All you have to do is run away
And steal yourself from me
Become a mystery to gaze into
You’re so cruel in all you do
But still, I believe, I believe in you
So may you come with your own knives
You’ll never take me alive
With all the force of what is true
Is there nothing I can do?
I can’t go on
Digging roses from your grave
To linger on
Beyond the beyond
Where the willows weep
And the whirlpools sleep
You’ll find me
And the night mare rides on
And the night mare rides on
With a December black psalm
And the night mare rides on
I’ve faced the fathoms in your deep
Withstood the suitor's quiet siege
Pulled down the heavens just to please you
To hold the flower I can’t keep

What if the sun refused to shine?
What if the clouds refused to rain?
What if the wind refused to blow?
What if the seas refused to wave?
What if the world refused to turn?
What if the stars would hesitate?

What if, what is isn’t true?
What are you going to do?
What if, what is isn’t you?
Does that mean you’ve got to lose?
Digging for the feel of something new

What if the silence let you dream?
What if the air could let you breathe?
What if the words would bring you here?
What if this sound could bring you peace?

What if, what is isn’t true?
What are you going to do?
Digging for the feel of something new
What if, what is isn’t you?
What are you going to do?

It came from your thoughts, your dreams and visions
Ripped up from your weeks and indecisions

What if the sun refused to shine?
What if the clouds refused to rain?
What if the world refused to turn?
What if the clocks would hesitate?

What if, what is isn’t true?
What are you going to do?
What if, what is isn’t you?
Does that mean you’ve got to lose?
Digging for the feel of something new

Does that mean you’ve got to choose
The feel of something new?
Does that mean you’ve got to lose
The thoughts you cannot use?
What are you gonna do?

This time I need to know
I really must be told
If it’s over
It’s up to you, you know
The things you want to hold
Are in pieces

Crashing down
Crashing down again
Crashing down
Crashing down, my friends

I’ve got to move it on
I’ve got to sing my song
While I still can
Dispatch the last alarms
Hand out the last few charms
There’s no surprises

Only love
Only love can win
Crashing down
Crashing down, my friends
Only love
Only love will win
Crashing down
Crashing down again

This time I need to know
I really must be told
That it’s over
I’ve lived my life alone
My every step foretold
To never linger
And yet it haunts me so
What we are letting go
Our spell is broken

Crashing down
Crashing down, my friends
Crashing down
Crashing down again
Only love, yeah
Only love will be enough
Yeah, only love will win

For every chemical
You trade a piece of your soul
With no return
And who you think you know
Doesn’t know you at all
Their drain is needless
Someday we’ll wave hello
And wish we’d never waved goodbye
To this romance
We’ll drink up every line
And shoot up every word
Till there’s no more

Crashing down
Crashing down, my friends
Only love
Only love can win

So cry these tears
We’ll cry as all
We’ve held so long
To fall apart
As the curtain falls
We bid you all goodnight

I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
Ooh, and every time I heard you breathe
Well I sighed
Ooh, and every time I saw you bleed
Well I cried
Love is like a song
And if you sing
If you ever need me
I'll be there in a while
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
Ooh, and everytime that I'm with you
I'm alive
Ooh, and everytime I think of you
There's a light
And I felt it, too
In my heart is a spring
Is a well, if you need
If you drink, if you heal
If you believe in
Every little part of me is a part of you
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
The boy, the boy's in love
The boy, the boy's in love
The boy, the boy's in love
The boy, the boy's in love

Radio, play my favorite song
Radio, radio
Radio, I’m alone
Radio
Radio, please don't go
Radio

I peer through curtains on empty streets
Behind a wall of caller ID
No one’s out there
To hear if I care
About the troubles in the air

‘Cause I of the morning now go
Pick up where my thoughts left off
‘Cause I’m home to die on my own

As my radio plays my favorite song
Radio, radio
Radio, don’t you know
Radio, radio
Radio, I’m alone


I’ve blown the dust off my guitar
In the attic with the stars
I read your letters to feel better
My tears upon the faded ink

‘Cause I of the morning now go
Pick up where my thoughts left off
‘Cause I’m home to die on my own

As my radio plays my favorite song
Radio, radio
Radio, I'm alone
Radio, radio
Radio, please don't go

I sit in the dark light
To wait for ghost night
To bring the past to life
To make a toast to life
‘Cause I have survived

What is it you want?
What is it you want to change?
What is it you want?
What is it you want to change?
What is it you want to change?

Radio, radio, radio, radio
Radio, radio, radio, radio
Radio, radio, radio, radio


What is it you want?
What is it you want to change?
What is it you want?
What is it you want to change?
What is it you want to change?

To the center of the earth
Or anywhere God decides
Full of fever pulling forth
We hear our call as all
To the center of the earth
As if written in
DNA is reaching out
To your frequency
I want to live
Don’t want to die
I want to live
I want to try
All in prayer
Prayer in all
All are scared
Scared of all
Black rooms are calling
To men in leather coats
White labs are cooking
Up the silver ghost
The glass migrates under
Her translucent skin
And all the spiders
Wonder what we’ve got us in
All is you
You are all
All with you
You in all
I want to live
I don’t want to die
I want to live
I want to try
“So it’s all very obtuse, because it’s all, like, I don’t know. So, like, I started thinking that everything I operate on is based on what I believe God was telling me to do. God could be my intuition or whatever, but I always assume, I always assume that the voice I hear is the voice of God. Then I started thinking, what if I’m insane? So I’m operating on the premise that I’m hearing the voice of God or what I perceive to be God speaking to me or through me, but maybe I’m completely in… so all my… demagoguery in my life about me thinking that my life has importance, my… my… thinking that my life has importance. My… my… my thought of it and the fact that I believe I’m following my intuition which in and of itself may be completely false so then I started freaking out, thinking–of itself may be completely false. And again this totally insane creature that believes he’s acting upon heavenly intuition but meanwhile he’s totally rampant. And I started thinking maybe this is the cause of all the negativity against–and I started thinking maybe this is the cause of all the negativity against–and I started thinking maybe this is the cause of all the negativity against…”
So meets the final coda of a vinyl storm
One more cherry cola to lift up her dead arms
A dream of soft focus, sunsets filters through the dim
We are losing contact as she dials it in
She can hear Glass calling, or is it someone that looks like him?
She eyes TV reflection, and nods a knowing look
She says it doesn’t matter, she never liked her looks
I have seen a thousand fractures, I have seen everything
‘Cause knowing is its own answer, love something in a book
There’s not much left to ponder, not much left to cook
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her
As she counted the spiders, as they crawled up inside her

I've wasted all my years
Been chasin' all my fears
For another brighter than you
I gave in long ago to make it to the show
But it's not easy when you're alone

All your prayers
In my ears
Don't you care?

Whir yourself around
Just to fall back down
Whir yourself around

My honey, little girl
Come on, lets go for a whirl
It's still early, the sun is sleeping

She says she wants to marry me
She says she wants a baby
It's not easy when you're scared
Whir yourself around
Just to fall back down
Whir yourself around

All your prayers
In my ears
Don't you care?

Born to please, every simple need
I stand alone in my thoughts indeed
Hate you
For ever making me
I'm in you, I'm your anything
And I want you
And I need you
And all you are is brand new
And I need you
Come to me, let me hold you still
I'm so tired, just as tired as you
Take me for anyone but me
All that you feel is never true
And I want you
And I need you
And all you are is brand new
And I need you
When you say that you are
Forever my star
I'll never let you go, no, no
I'll never let you know
Let roar these fears
To the whore of my tears
Pure as a lie, I pour to your eyes
Suck you like the sap from a tree
Honey from the dew, from the bumblebees, yeah yeah
And I want you
And I need you
And all you are is brand new
And I need you
When you say that you are
Forever my star
I'll never let you go, no, no
I'll never let you know
And I want you
And I need you
And all you are is brand new
And I need you

You're an empty promise
You're an easy chair
You're the gods forces
Struck down somewhere
You're a secret noticed
You're a mystery sky
You're a wish floating
Up to the night
Medellia of my eyes
You're the emptiness of I
You're the reason that I write
And if you say you will
I would love you still
And if I could
I'd throw away this world
I'd dress you all in pearls
I'd give you what you wanted
You're all I notice
In a crowded room
Your vacant motives
Unmoved, revealed
Medellia of my eyes
You're the emptiness of I
You're the reason that I drive
And if you say you will
I would love you still
And if I just could
Be anything for you
Just anyone at all
Anything that mattered, washed out
You're the silly reasons
In a goldfish laugh
You're the ageless seasons
At rest, at last

Window paine
Around my heart
Shadows streak
Around my heart

Do what you got to do
And say what you got to say
Do what you got to do
Yes, start today
Start today

Wind blow shame
Around my heart
Shadows scream
Around my heart

What are you coming to
Stripped down to the bone?
Laughing, living
On your own
All alone


Do what you got to do
And say what you got to say
Do what you got to do
Yes, start today
Start today

Dusty screams
Through doors and imaginary floors
"Why can't you miss me?"
Pistol Pete
Removes the final breaths from her, unkind
And she is shaken
What does this mean?
In love or in peace?
With you lying next to me
So faithless, serene
And she calls to him
Let the waste
Cross the ancient trails to you
Far out
Beneath the sorrow clouds
Let them taste
The bitter, lost mistake of you
Let them cry out
Through your rusted scars
Alone, he roams
Inside the ordinary catacombs
Of her waiting
With raven hands
She steals and staggers towards her man
Still scorned by his demon
Because he's undone
Become the language of
Disaster and love
Vengeance and dust
And she calls to him
Let the waste
Cross the ancient trails to you
Far out
Beneath the sorrow clouds
Let them taste
The bitter, lost mistake of you
Let them cry out
Through your rusted scars
Dusty screams
Through doors and imaginary scenes
Of hurt and teardrop
As he holds her down
In the cold, lonely winds
Together again
Her inside him
And she calls to him
Let the waste
Cross the ancient trails to you
Far out
Beneath the sorrow clouds
Let them taste
The bitter, lost mistake of you
Let them cry out
Through your rusted scars

Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops

I send my echo out
To get your love without
Obscured reflections of
My love

Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops

I’ll save a prayer for you
So lost and longing to
Be dragged through dirty streets
Wrapped up in clean white sheets
And if you think they’ll watch you now
You should know they won’t

Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops

I send my echo out
To get your love without
Obscured reflections of
Of my secret love
Force down the words about
To get your love without
Obscured reflections of my love
And I’m just trying to talk to you
Between the raindrops

Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops
Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops
