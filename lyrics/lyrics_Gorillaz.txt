City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got a kissing 'cause I don't get to sleep, no
(*beep*)

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear repping in harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc.
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
Until you're cheddar headed
And watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha
(Ha! Haha! Haha! Haha! Ha!)

Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future
Is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future

You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?
Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya 
They tryna dinosaur us so now it's time to go up

Police everywhere, it's like a nigga killed a white man
I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end
So don't be coming 'round Vince on that batter ram shit
On that 911 shit, need a misses brown as Missy
I can have some fun with, them slave bones make Grace Jones
Don't stop, bitch, stay focused, they hated on us since days of Moses
Let my people go crazy, them stars falling, don't chase 'em

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby

Attack on Iraq, it's on a line
Typing it fast, then it's slipping my mind
Oh, when I'm drunk, I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage 'cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition, well, nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness and recalling it all
And I’m a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a-

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn {Obama} to my partner 'fore he dash
Pull up to the pad, wipe my ass with the flag
I'm just playing, baby, this the land of the free
Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree
(Aghh!)

Up on Melancholy Hill, there's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day of another dream
Where you can't get what you want, but you can get me
So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine when you're close to me
When you're close to me

So call in the submarines, 'round the world we'll go
Does anybody know her
If we're looking out on the day of another dream?
If you can't get what you want, then come with me
Up on Melancholy Hill
Sits the manatee, love
Just looking out for the day when you're close to me
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

When the pulsing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart

Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

Take it in your heart now, love her
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Where it all goes down

Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
I put it to the right man
He put it back

Talk to the crowds
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

Take it in your heart now, love her
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Where it all goes down

Andromeda
Andromeda, Andromeda
Take it in your heart now, love her
Andromeda, Andromeda
Andromeda, Andromeda
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Where it all goes down

Calling the world from isolation
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
And if you're coming back to find me
You'd better have good aim

Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

Calling the hunter with the rifle
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained

Shoot it true, I want you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you down?

Slow it down some, no split, clown bum
Your gold hits sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
Where you found them at?
Got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it
Would have floated, bloated, voted
Sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
Draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast, roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well you know, November has come
When it's gone away
(Oh, what they say)
Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well you know, November has come
When it's gone away

Bah, can you dig it like a spigot?
My guess is yes you can, like can I kick it, wicked,
Liquor shot if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
Grope a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Doper rhymin' more worther than the Hope Diamond
Acquired off the black market
A wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
The rapid-fire spark lit (zzzt!) a rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
Plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
The beats got family members askin' him for closure
Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em clean it
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong of Billabong
That said "Nah fo'real-a, the Villain on a Gorilla jawn?"

Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?

I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

In my backpack, I got my act right in case you act quite difficult
And your result weaken
With anger and discontent some are seeking
And in search of like Nimoy
I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
I change your whole location to a pine box, six under
Impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is strike and I'm thunder
With lightning-fast reflexes
On constant alert from the constant hurt
That seems limitless with no drop in pressure
It seems like everybody's out to test ya, 'till they see you break
You can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a ninety-day extension and I'm filled with guilt
From things that I seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
"The war is over", so said the speaker
With the flight suit on
Maybe to him, I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance?
Man, all I wanna do is dance

I need a gun to keep myself among

Mama Mavis, oh, Mama, they tried my patience
{Obama} is gone, who is left to save us?
{Orlando,} we mourn, I'm praying for my neighbors
They say the devil's at work and {Trump} is calling favors
You say I'm dangerous, I speak for the nameless
I fly with the vultures, I be with them bangers
If change don't come, then the change won't come
If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
(Woo!)

Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark, let me out)
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it

Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out

Look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
Tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
Tell me that I won't die at the hands of the police
Promise me I won't outlive my nephew and my niece
Promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
Tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that I teach
Tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
But until then, I keep my piece in arm's reach

Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark) Another night
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change coming
You'd best be ready for it

Summer don't know me no more
He got mad, that's all
Summer don't know me
He'd just let me low in myself
'Cause I do know love
From you then, just dying

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time, you'll want to be mine

Don't stop the bud, when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight, you'll flee
If you do that
I'll be sworn
To find you

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time, you'll want to be mine

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine

I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
The shadow in the corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if I get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say "I'm leaving" to you
You've gotta volunteer, and you don't know what to do
You're soft

You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doin'?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

I’m impregnable, incredible, the setting of quo
I’m at Lay Chimirida, not a heart and soul
I got a Saturday night, and nothing is dead
And if I ever had to do it, well, you know I wouldn’t care
I just kicked down, I love when I’m seen
Yeah, and if I wanna talk back, the message is free
Then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
And if you get popped here, you get ‘em a lot
You get a heart, break

You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doin'?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care
But it's true, you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

New word, onomatopoeia (Boom)
Quit actin' like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
Get the fuck on, gone
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
My girl look pretty up there riding dick
My plaid past, my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an OutKast but you're into me
Summer got mad cause the winter blew me
That Juicy Fruit, that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty bloop
Get duked, gotta get duked, the duke
Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney, I commend me
How come it be, some lame ass nigga talking about
"Ah, he don't rap enough"
But y'all rap a lot and I'm like "Wrap it up, hoe"
You ain't Scarface, you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick, you ain't killin' me
Better play with your motherfuckin' momma
Bet you still stay with your motherfuckin' momma
Keep sleeping on me, I'ma rock my pajamas
In the daytime, I swear, I promise
Dare a nigga say something, tear a nigga face off
How come Blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white, know y'all can taste all this
Fly shit, I stay finna take off

Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
You ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga, you that Tang
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane

Bet it up, head erupts
A lava language in a vocal volcanic
If it ain't fixed, don't broke it, don't panic
If it ain't this, it ain't shit, goddamn it
If it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush
And if it ain't hip, it don't hop, well then hush
Man, they sound like, man, they stole your
Man, they look like—nope, it ain't us

Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing

Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care (I don't care)
But it's true, you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

Flip the page, our days are revelatious
Space is strange, doctor, I've got no patience
Oh, it's all a part of the process (Okay, okay)
Nothing's new, it's true, cool, I admit
Shit, I guess you're right

The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I've tried to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Yeah, yeah
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between its brain and its tail
And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose

Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Yeah, yeah

Okay, bring it down here
We goin' back out

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Momentary bliss

We could do so much better than this
Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

You're potential, you lack credentials
And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)
Oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
And you keep squeezing the truth from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You parted seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)
And you was gaggin' for some gags and now you're rollin' (Woo)
Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)
On another note, compliments make me blush
There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
Cavern of your mind, you say your pattern
You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say: (Ah, ah, ah)
"What was scripted, the day before it happened?"
We all give applause when people open doors
But on the way out and get your back in
See, everything in life ain't silver and gold
But minin' for metal gave you platinum

It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin to think light bulb don't blink
Just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

Poster boy (Ayy)
Poster girl (Rita)
Truth, the bills (The bills)
Must be paid (Yeah, yeah, alright)
Poster boy (Yeah, alright)
Poster girl (Ah, that's time)

In truth, the bills, they must be paid (Uh-huh)
And what is left is sodding atypical
All you need to change your face
You're gettin' sold, you're such a waste
You know, we could do so much better than this
Swimmin' in pools of momentary bliss
Where you gotta find a family 'cause everybody taken
They worry you keep on adding
I think you gotta crawl

It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulb don't blink
Just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulbs don't blink
Just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

We could do so much better than this
Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita
We could do so much better than this
Perfect little pictures of moments that we missed
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

(Uh)
(Mmmmm)

I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, "Taxi"
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

(Here we go again)
That's electric
(Uh)
That's electric

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)

Okay, last time
This is drugs
This is your brain on drugs
Any questions?

I was gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

I'm back, where are we going?
Seem to get tired of the morning dawn
With a basin on my head
I'm missin' all that I used to know, then
I get the kids to go
And I get up on with certain dread
And when I see the kissing down below
Easy life, I get right

I was gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
(Yeah, I get myself upright)
With the self of the day, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

I get dropped from where I belong
I take my pills and I get in the mode
And I take five to get it to load in
Even in the place
And I get my jeans on right
And sit in the rows and
Inside, I live in a cage and I
Peek out and summon the code
And I enter the lake to face what I'm cagin'

Gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
(Yeah, I get myself upright)
With the self of the day, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

She gave me sleeping powder
I was gone
Gone, gone, gone

(I was gone!)
I was gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone (Yeah, I get myself upright)
With the self of the day, gone
(I was gone)
Gone, gone, gone, gone
I was gone, gone, gone
I was gone

They're mesmerized
Skeletons

Kids with guns

Easy does it, easy does it

Drinking out (Push it real)
Pacifier (Push it real, push it)
Vitamin souls (Push it, push it real)
The street desire (Push it real, push it)
Doesn't make sense to (Push it, push it real)
But it won't be long (Push it real, push it)

Easy does it, easy does it

Turning us into fire

Drinking out

Sinking soul
There you are
Doesn't make side to

Oscillate yourself tonight
When you're in your bed
Simulate the dopamine
Passing through your head

When you get back on a Saturday night
And the room is caving in

Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

See yourself in Cupid's lake
Chipped in your head
Do you indicate to satellites
Passing by the edge?

When you get back on a Saturday night
And your head is caving in

Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?
Do you dance like this forever?

Do you look like me?
Do you burn like me?
Do you look like me?
Do you burn like me?
Do you look like me?
Do you burn like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?

Do you dance like this forever?
Do you dance like this forever?

If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now (She's my collar)
I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her
I take her down to somewhere drab and naughty
I clear my system, I don't need no other
This is my persona, secret lover
(She's my collar)
Nothing to be justified in
Just one thing, you should feel nada
I know she lies alone, she's my caller
I sense her in my mind, she's my collar

She's the serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message, never call her
And now I wanna taste another
And it's safe in a persona, she's my collar
Nothing to be justified yet
She the first I'm running with
She the one that get my collar
She the one I'm running with

She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar

I'm yellow, he was blue
It's nothing that he could hide
We made a green meadow
Whenever we would collide
She's my collar
I died a thousand times
I did what I had to do
Hey, that's just how it goes
I'm still coming back to you

If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
(You, you, you)
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her
(You, you, you, you)
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now
(She's my collar)
I don't take her number just don't think I'd call her
(You, you, you)
I take a damn summer dreading all day
(You, you, you, you)
I clear my system, I don't need no other
(You, you, you)
This is my persona, secret lover
(She's my collar)

She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar
Oh, she's my collar

Oh, joys are us, the sun has come again to hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you
It's all around you, out here

And if the whole world is crashing down (on you)
Fall through space out of mind with me

Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away
The falling of the whole empire, is here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sleeps

Little memories, marching on
Your little feet, working the machine
Say will it spin, will it soar?
My little dream, working the machine
Soon, like a wave, empires will fall
And closing in on you, they're going on
Little memories
Your little feet, working the machine
Say will it spin, will it soar?
My little dream, working the machine
Soon like a wave, empires will fall
Closing in on you, they're going on

Where does it come from?
When everything was outside
Busted and blue
How in the universe?
Through the lithium
Busted and blue

I was asked by a computer
A shadow on the wall
An image made by Virgil
To rule over us all
So amplify the sirens
And to find real amends
I'm through the echo-chambers
To other worlds I went

All my life
All my life
Beam a light on me
I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my light
Be my light

Where do they come from?
The wires that connect to us
Weightless and fall on your body
'Til we're invisible
I'm with you through altitudes
Busted and blue

All my life
All my life
Beam a light on me
I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my light
Be my light

Busted and blue

Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments

Main event, yellow, red
Black, white, dirty

Shiver down my backbone

De La is also back again (Uh-huh)
With a crew that's bound to pack 'em in (Uh-huh)
Got a girl who's up for the matin'
I sense the need in her grammar
Her nose has never been skatin' (Uh-huh)
But she's sippin' star constellation (Shit)
For real, her squirt game was so like 2Pac out of court run towards camera (Uh-huh)
My response to that was just, "Check please"
Fuck that, my man, you can't let these (Moments)
Pass you by like "tick tock"
So I'm smackin' the bottom like flip flops
Made her alarm ring (She screams)
And now we done, we passed the test
So now lay down to rest
And wait for the mornin' hangover that comes

Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive

Here is our tree
That primitively grows
And when you go to bed
Scarecrows from the far east
Come to eat
Its tender fruits
And I thought the best way to perfect our tree
Is by building walls
Walls like unicorns
In full glory and galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho
But glad then my friend
Out in the field, we shall reap a better day
What we have always dreamt of having
Are now for the starving
It is love, that is the root of all evil
But not our tree
And thank you, my friend
For trusting me

Hallelujah
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujah money
(Past the chemtrails)
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hmmm
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujah money
(Oooh)

How will we know?
When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

Don't worry, my friend
If this be the end, then so shall it be
Until we say so, nothing will move
Ah, don't worry
It's not against our morals
It's legally tender
Touch, my friend
While the whole world
And whole beasts of nations desire
Power

When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money

We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power for that
We got the power to do that

And, we dream of home
I dream of life out of here
Their dreams are small
My dreams don't know fear
(I got all you)
I got my heart full of hope
I will change everything
No matter what I'm told
How impossible it seems
(We got the power)
We did it before
And we'll do it again
We're indestructible
Even when we're tired
And we've been here before
Just you and I
Don't try to rescue me
I don't need to be rescued

We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power for that
We got the power to do that

Get yourself up to the silent altar and call me
But don't forget the machines
'Cause if your choice is chipping it down on the M1
Then you'll wake up in the morning
You'll be storming, oh, oh, oh

We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power to do that

Love, electricity, shockwave central
Power on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on

When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (it's the giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes (as it leaps from the stream)
Then I'll know the twilight skies (blood curdles, it's a death throw)
Are not so broken hearted (hot from the end of the line)

If it's love, it's electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

Sing yourself (juice)

All recession, if I know your heart
Electric is the love

If you see me floating too many times
My face will be painted in these white brick lines

'Cause all my fears invaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

And if you say goodbye too many times
The sentinels will find me and switch me off this time

'Cause all my fear's evaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

If all you ever get from the summit is the count of the fall of man
Every call and cost made to your heart
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
I was ever chasing fireflies

Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I'm love drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?

LA why you're so complicated for me, twilight
Waiting on the planet to turn to me, dark side
If loving you's a felony now, then I'm a renegade, riding
Trying to find tomorrow ain't easy 'til you dive in
Swimming pools

Why you rolling waves over me now, that's all I need, dreaming
Waiting on LA to come find me, be forgiven
I'll be a regular guy for you, I never said I'd do that
Why you looking so beautiful to me now when you so sad?

I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back on my way through

I wanna stay with you for a long time; I wanna be stone, love
I wanna see LA in your eyes when I'm leaving with your love

I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back, 'cause I got to run soon

I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back on my way through

Pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
We're here tonight for a very special offering
An offering of our spirits this evening in unison
But first, a word of instruction

Hello, hello
Please leave all your belongings at the door
You can sit or stand, we can take a vote
And just tiptoe to the centre of the circle
While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes
Some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
Ready, set, go
I lock hands with yours
We dive into the floor (drop)
When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more (drop)
I lock hands with yours
And then we dive down into the floor
Seven thousand miles 'til we reach the core
And then we circle back and we stomp some more, got it?
It's just like that
You promise all your life, then you turn your back
You glide across the space, and diagonal past
Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times, and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what any of this is about?
No? Well, work it out

Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright

Okay, slide like a lizard, walk like a crab
Eyes dilated, dark to the grass
Then when you find you're invisible, you melt into a puzzle
Keep it flowing like the rivers do
You gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
And if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
Don't take the chance, not worth the risk

Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright

Who knows?
There's always stains on what's real and true
Tonight is a special, special occasion
And all that's left for us to do, is move

Ooh, I, I
Where am I going?
What am I doing?
I, I'm alive
Alive
I can fly
I, I'm so alive
I'm so, I'm so high

(Everybody)
Everybody says I'm busted and blue
I feel better when I don't need that
Everybody gonna funk the night
It's so big, big, big
Everybody says that I'm more
Feelin' out of body, I'm drinkin' it up
Can I tell you what the dream's about tonight?
(Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright)

This morning, you've got time for a hot home cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only three microwaved minutes
Are you kidding?!

Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights
(Look, it comes with a toy! I like that)
(I wanna number four, number six, and throw in a plastic donut)
Just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken
Rappers of many bite sizes
(Man, are you freaking blind
That's a rock)
All mixed in the pot full
Momma's homemade from scratch, but (not quite)
Toasted over flames they be tasting (quite right)

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
"Don't waste time" with your net
Our net worth is set
Ready, go many know others but
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it
With the twenty-four hour sign
Shower mine habits
While you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh that's chicken)
Gotta have it super fast

A whole line of breakfasts you've got time for

Super fast, super fast
I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through, whatever blue
The night, the night throws at us
Aluminum I crush for fun, aluminum
The sea is radioactive, the sea is radioactive

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
"Don't waste time" with your net
Our net worth is set
Ready, go, many know others but
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it
With the twenty-four hours sign
Shower mine habits
While you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh, that's chicken)
Gotta have it super fast

Super fast, super fast
I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through, whatever blue
The night, the night throws at us
Aluminum I crush for fun, aluminum
The sea is radioactive, the sea is radioactive

Superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish
(Don't waste time)
Superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish
(The sea has gone silent)
(What!)
(Everybody loves jellyfish!)
(Everybody loves jellyfish!)
(Everybody loves jellyfish!)
(Everybody loves jellyfish!)
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish

Momentary pain can be pleasure lain
Millisecond change; magic lantern strange
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian? Is this how it ends?

Girl, your life will turn, just like a strobe
'Cause your daddy's vain, and your mother won't
And your heart engages into heartless throes
Are we obsidian? Is this how it goes?

If when your private life is dreaming
You're living the strobe light
And you will find the life you're needing
You're living the strobe light

Slide the light off you, you may find some peace
All will come to you, if you come with me
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian? Is this how it is? Yeah

If when your private life is dreaming (When your pri-)
You're living the strobe light (Oh, living the strobe light)
And you will find the life you're needing
You're living the strobe light
{unintelligible vocals}


And when your private life is dreaming
You're living the strobe light
(You're living the strobe, when your private life is dreaming)
And you will find the life you're needing
(You'll find the life you're needing)
You're living the strobe light
And when your private life is dreaming
(When your private life is dreaming)
You're living the strobe light
(Living the strobe, you're living the strobe)
And you will find the life you're needing
(You will find the life you're needing, yeah yeah yeah)
You're living the strobe light

Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
And when you're private
And then you're dreaming
(You're living the strobe light)
You hit the light
When your private life is dreaming
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
You've got to find it
You know you need it
(Like you need it)
(You're living the strobe light)
You're living the strobe light
You hit the light
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
When your private life is
And when you're private
Dreaming
And then you're dreaming
(You living the strobe light)
You hit the light
You're living the, living the
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
You've got to find it
You know you need it

You can be mad at me, tell me I was born to quit
I was checking gold
Or you could just freak with me
Said it again, let the numbers roll
I hear that about you, baby
It's back when the city's cold
(It's cold, cold, cold)
Don't ever look at me like that
It's just in the daylight, no
It's just in the daylight, no

(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold
I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)

Why are you mad at me? Tell me I was born to quit
I was checking gold
You should just freak with me, freak with me
And let the numbers roll
I'm here by the fire, I'm waiting
Back where the city's cold
(It's cold, cold, cold)
Don't ever look at me like that
It's just in the days I've known
It's just in the days I've known

Yo, new black king, New York dream
Tell these motherfuckers everything I'm seeing
My world's darker than the young black dream
Of the first black prince of a new white king
I just wanna play, have it my way
Make a bunch of fucking rules, then tell 'em obey
They can't fuck with me, yeah, yeah, Ojay
First name, government? No, him, I slay
New black king, oh
New black king, yeah
New black king, oh
Uh, obey, obey, obey

(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it

Aries

I'm looking out at a volcano
Trying to read the world today and see where you're at
I'll never do that
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silenced

I'm standing on a beach in the distance
And even though you're far away, can you see my red light?
It's waiting to turn green
'Cause I feel so isolated without you
I can't play a happy tune on my own, so stay by my side
High or low tide

High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
Feels like I'm falling in, again

I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silenced

High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
Feels like I'm falling in, again

Don't try to hide away
You know you've been on
Though I'm keeping calm, I'm not on
Go away, my love
Thought I could change our fate
I tried again, but this delay
It's more than I can take

And it got to me
When you state your love
And you walk away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
I will be full-on
If it's up to me
It's all I got

Feels so good doing me
If you take a look at the time you took and move on
But don't go too far, my lover
We could try harder, baby
There's gotta be a better way
So much that we could make it

And it got to me
When you state your love
But you run away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
Gotta be full-on
It is up to me
It's all I got

It's all I got
It's all I got
It's all I got

Wish I could think of better ways
'Cause I lost my patience yesterday
If you could see inside of me
There'd be no heart on my X-ray
Opponents tryna checkmate
But I don't see no escape
Just tryna keep my head straight
On thin ice with the ice skates
At times, I feel like givin' up
'Cause it feels like I've had enough
Felt like my soul in handcuffs
Got questions with no answers
Can't help me out, I need a friend
I'm losin' faith in this world of sin
Tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
It's like a cycle that never ends
I can't contend with no handlin'
I can't take care of no grown man
All by myself, cryin' for help
But won't get saved by no Superman
All comes down to the mighty dollar
Greed and lust, abusin' power
Clock is tickin', hour after hour
Makes me wanna throw my hands and holler

And you got to me
When you state your love
But you run away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
Gotta be full-on
It is up to me

Everybody's here with me
We've got no camera to see
Don't think I'm all in this world

The verdict doesn't love our soul
The digital won't let me go

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll pay
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today


Stereo, I want it on
It's taken me far too long
Don't think I'm all in this world
Don't think I'll be here too long
Don't think I'll be here too long, no
(Don't think I'll be here too long)
I don't think I'll be here too long
(I don't think I'll be here too long)

Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses
But no one noticed them, they only saw shadows
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind

Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

In time, Strangefolk found their way into the high reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable, sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
Its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time
The Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep
And then came a sound, distant first
It grew into castrophany
So immense it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called Monkey had spoken, there was only fire
And then...nothing

O little town in U.S.A., your time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me? No...

To the dark, dark seas
Comes the only whale
Watching ships go by
It's the day we try

It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio

Did they haul you out
On a really hot day?
When the call got made
You had gone away
From us

It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio

Casio, Casio, Casio and green, green glow
Casio, Casio, Casio, green, green glow
Casio, Casio, Casio and green, green glow

It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill

Waiting by the mailbox, by the train
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as thunder comes a-rolling down
Someone to rely on as the lightning comes a-staring in again

I'll wait to be forgiven, maybe I never will
My star has left me to take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling, well, the cause of it's a lesson learned
"Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Just don't know if I could do it all again," she said—it's true

Waiting in my room, and I lock the door
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance and I'm listening to the whispers
And oh, it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling
And you're falling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again

I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry but you're feeling it
But I just have to tell you that I love you so much these days
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true

My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again
Cau-au-au-aught again
(Cau-au-au-aught again)
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy (Cau-au-au-aught again)
Rolling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again

Distant stars
Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head
They connect
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
Then dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is in outer heart
And the space has been broken

It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken

Is it far away
In the Glitter Freeze
Or in our eyes
Every time they meet
It's by the light
Of the plasma screens
We keep switched on
All through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart
And the space has been broken

It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken

Jealousy and dark times

So you have to be prepared

Little did they know, no sweat
So I dimmed out, rimmed out and cracked the glass
Twenty-five pounds, can you match that bag?
'Cause if you not, raise up
I got a deal to make
And a couple bad bitches
I've been achin' to break
Wakin' and bake
I put the cake on the plate
Jealousy and me? Oh, we're making a date
I'ma vibe with this, Hollywood, nigga I'ma survive this shit

Forreal-a, gorilla, who loves goin' bareback
They wanna eye me down, tie me down, knock me off
But I'm a lion in the dogg pound
Now, how that sound?

I lost my land like I lost my way
So no loose ends
Nothing to see me down
How are we going to work this out?

Dreams are bad, our heads are mad
I love the girl
But God only knows it's
Getting hard to see the sun coming through
I love you...
But what are we going to do?

Picture I'm a dreamer
I'll take you deeper
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low
Don't you know?
What are we going to do?
When we go down
For all the sacred selfless days
Only left with heartache
I want to see you again
I love you...
But what are we going to do?

Skin of my tooth like, skin of my boot like
Fly in my soup like, "Where's the waitress?"
Can I take this, really, can I finish this?
These airs and all these graces
It's my mistake, I'll make it
J-dub to the boom now make it
Bounce, wiggle, bounce, wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats, bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted Cain, I'll twist a-gain

Known to what these sayers say

Alrighty
Prince Paul
Uh, ah

You can freak me out, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can borrow my hands and tell me I'm not here
I'm a mad Pac-Man, livin' in a leveled world
Everywhere I go I don't know where I am

You can call me cracked, you can call me mad and stifled
You can hold my hand, sail me into bathing light
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, no stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out, stressin' out

You can hide your head, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can borrow my days and tell me I'm not blue
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

No stressin' out, no stressin' out

Uh, how can I trust truth?
Uh, when I ain't got nothin' to sell
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell
Uh, why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tails?
Ayy, can't dream if my ego is broke, nah
The jokes that try to find the answer to nope (Uh)
My type of drive, you can't buy this shit
You got a heart but it don't beat like this
I had a spark, then my mind went trip
Create the wave so the vibe all mix

(I'm a mad Pac-Man) Suu
(Livin' in a leveled world)

Yo, I been at the top of the top
Fell from the ceiling before I fail
'Cause I needed to grow, Bruce Lee, royal with the glow
Uh, walked on the edge, fuck tryna dream in the bed
'Fore I die on these meds, niggas gon' die on the feds
'Fore I make it to jail, prolly put one in the head
Fuck the judge and the prosecutor for hangin' me dead
Plus thirty and still movin', I'm closer to live, right?
Closer to live, right?
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights
Normal to fly now, can't be stuck in the red lights
Take flight, the life gon' bloom for the Black Knight
Keep a piece, no Buddhist, got the whole hood boomin'
I'm like a Crip how I stewed it, you on your ass, stuck, stupid
You makin' we look bad, I rock the beat, won't crash
I had to fill my bag, I had to hide my stash
You know the cops' lights flash, I had to clear my dash
I represent my flag, I gave the hood my last
Every full-grown minute, I had to change my image
The brain don't got limits, you think a mill' mean winnin'
Pigs out here skinnin', your soul ain't authentic
You died and still ain't livin'

(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

Gravitational pull'll have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins, running man and more
Party down with vigor and candor
Coming to the jam or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie, win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet, turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy, seeing all the treasure and the booty

And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down

Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

I want to get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than Funkadelic wearing Pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparing answers
Sharing transcripts, while we over here
Dipping and dancing, rhythm romancing
Wallflowers, giving no action, no
All hours we chillin' and maxin'
So relaxin', opposites attractin'
I'ma toss my hat in, floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack bend, jigglin' and wigglin'
Freaking booties, speaking to the cuties so belligerent
No religion, just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn, negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it responds

Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

Magic for me
Magic makes no sound
It good for me
It good for me underground
Magic on me
Really got me down
Invade the city
It made my heart beat no sound

Beat no sound
Beat no sound (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Beat no sound
Beat no sound
Beat no sound (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

And let me tell myself
Tell on

She turned my dad on
She turned my dad on, dad on, dad on

Magic for me
Magic, get me through
With magic money
People seem to walk through you
Magic's funny
Magic, get me through
All good for me
When people seem to always walk through you

Walk through you (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you

O green world
Don't desert me now
Bring me back to fallen town
Where someone is still alive
Fighting for something new in this
When no one needs the heart of me
And I'm looking out somewhere I've never been before
Been before

O green world
Don't desert me now
Made of you and you of me
But where are we?
Oh no, sells to lie
From the darkest stars that force you
Down when you’re in first
Does it seem so little to you?
I know you now, I know
You know me too
You know me too
Hope, sex and drugs thrust into myself holy
It feels holy
It’s fun when you’re the father and in the place you were

I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

Am I incapable of healing
The memory of my fall from grace in your heart
I'm on my journey home
With no fuel alone
I think I'll coast a while

I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

'Cause I'm about to solve it
Put my engine back into overdrive
So I can breathe again, (photo) photosynthesize again (synthesize)
With the green hills of my home

I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream
I'm not gonna cry
(Pave the way to me)
I got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

But if I got it right, you'd tell me
And if I was wrong, then I'd disappear
But I'm incapable

I'm not gonna cry
(Pave the way to me)
I got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

Got off a plane to the countryside
I drove to the mountain and a hole in the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead
And fire coming out of the monkey's head

Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake

Put me in a cab to suburbia
I just took a line but it wasn't with you
There was more of it there, when I got back home
But you'd left me, you don't know my soul...
You're a hoe, girl
Yeah, you're a hobo

Don’t get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don’t go over the edge, hey
You’ll make a big mistake
Aaah-ahhh, you’ll make a big mistake
Aaah-ahhh, you’ll make a big mistake
Aaah-ahhh, you’ll make a big mistake
Aaah-ahhh, you’ll make a big mistake
Aaah-ahhh

Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Some kind of metal
Made up from glue
Some kind of plastic
I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades
They wear phony clothes
They sit with barbiturates
Until they grow old

Some kind of nature

Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold

Well, me, I like plastics
And digital foils
To wrap up the sound
And protect the girls
From the spiritual poison
You spill at night
Like phony clothes but
I really like mine

Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Come forth within us
Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
It's gonna come and find us
All we are is dust

Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls?

Take a gun, or how you say
That's no way
To behave
You’re just alone when you begin
To sing a song that doesn’t sin
It grows (hey) You know

Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls?

Are we the last to get away?
To a sun another day?
Or do we know
Well, we know
It doesn't seem to be conveyed that way

Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls?

Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up...
Lord, save me

'Cause all I've sung
I got it down and wrong
I've seen myself today
 The Lord, seeing all now
Can we take a sound?
I bought the car and all
The coldest man doesn't say it's wrong

We go to the car
I see you walk into the fog
And when you get there do you see?
You see the last, it's you and me

'Cause we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
Yeah, we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls

Is it resolution?
Or black and white flying balloons?
Floating off, too colourful
Or is it separation
You put it to your counting sand
Waiting for the world to start again?

Ticker tape
Ticker tape
Tick-tick-ticker tape

Is this how you're feeling?
Falling with the world tonight
Cauterized and beautiful
Slide the light
Is this how you're healing?
Out there in the paradigm
Waiting for a cavalcade to come again

Ticker tape
Ticker tape
Tick-tick-ticker tape
Ticker tape

Black light glints with colour
Sudden long and horizontal outlines the star
A sudden draft and quick chill
A single snowflake falls
And that is all
That is all
The world's face hidden under folding wing
Waiting for the world to start again
Waiting for the world to start again
Waiting for the world to start again
Waiting for the world... again

'Cause we're working through it
Working through your nightmare
Watch the worker bees
As they're working for it
Working through the night shift
And I'm working through it
Working through the nightmare
Watch the worker bees
As they're working for it
Working through the night shift
Are you leaving for the rest of it?
Coming back to ghosts inside
Or is it just too late for that?
And I'm hoping for a little juice

Déjalo
Si quieres continuar, hermano
Sal, ilumina tu vida
Todo el cielo aplastándote
Dime qué harás

Enfréntalo
Ilumina ese amor
Antes que se vaya
Algo siempre te entristece
Cuando todo va bien

¿Qué pasa contigo?
¿Qué pasa contigo?

Déjalo
Si quieres continuar
No ocultes tu alma al sol
Tienes una vida preciosa
De qué sirve si solo
Muerte sobre media ciudad

¿Qué pasa?
¿Qué pasa contigo?
¿Qué pasa contigo, mi hermano?
¿Qué pasa contigo?

Escucha a tu propia voz
Salva tu amor
¿Qué pasa contigo?
Antes que se vaya
Si todo va bien
¿Qué pasa contigo?
¿Qué pasa contigo?
Mírate a ti mismo
Enfréntalo
¿Qué pasa contigo?
Mi hermano
Ven animate
¿Qué pasa contigo?

Oh, palace flows
Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
When the light shines through it I feel more exposed
Will it ever change here? We'll just never know
Stimulation, I'm in need of
See the time is of the essence and this clock doesn't own a home
Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
When the light shines through I feel more exposed

In tune, with myself on it, my mind is my weakness
With your strength, you might surprise yourself
Never deny yourself, I live in the space is my thesis
I know you need this, I know you need this
I'm prone to run out of pieces
That might connect to something bigger
All in your mind, could follow me, you should consider
Look at the time, I'm probably later than ever
"What did you find?" Well come in here, and lit it with pressure
I look to the heavens and I saw open gates
I walked up and then I paused
What the fuck did you do this for?
Wish me luck when that midnight falls
Memories of a past life
Can this be? This is our time, can this be? This is our time
Come on

In stillness, known to the world, do you feel this?
Trapped in my mind, hope I can find solitude
When connecting all of these pieces
I know you need this, I know you need this
I fold and unleash the beast
Unknown is what I would be
If my whole purpose here wasn't to speak
Now look at the time, I know that I am early today
What did you find when giving up and running away?
I gazed to the stars and this view can't be shared
When there are no other eyes in this room
Mean the words when you sing your tune
Free as a bird when I intake fumes
Memories of this past life
Can this be? This is our time, can this be? This is our time
Come on

Give up if you wanna survive
Get oh so alive in your life
Everything falling out the sky on top of you
Now what you do?
Set yourself up now
It's the love of your life
Shallowly on me
All I know, before it's gone
I always feel it's getting you down
If nothing's wrong
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?

Give up if you wanna survive
Pick the sound back up
You got to get on the song, lonely
What's the point?
It's funny 'til you're left to kill yourself
In this town
So what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?

I'm on the high ridge looking down
While we're evolving in it all
If I get back then I'll be grateful
Look there's a billboard on the moon

Let me take you this far
This crossing isn't much to me
There's lightning in the storm clouds
And I'll send you there to stay

You got me lost in Magic City
You got me questioning it all
I hope that I make it home by Wednesday
And this Magic City lets me go

Magic City
Magic City
Magic City
Magic City

You put me up here in the penthouse
And painted me in red, white and blue
I filled the canyons with my ego
Look there's a billboard on the moon

You got me lost in Magic City
You got me questioning it all
I hope that I make it home by Wednesday
And this Magic City lets me go

Last chance to buy before you fly
Last chance to buy before you fly

Okay
In the morning it came to me
Build a tunnel from Zurich to New York
I find it hard to share this with anyone
Because even to me it sounded ridiculous
But one morning
After a long complicated night
I made my mind up, to share my vision with the world
Everything that follows
I'm not responsible for
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
I landed on the silver lake
Washed up and feeling blue
Heard the sound of footsteps
Drifting softly to the moon
Looking for clear water
I had to take control
Out there in the wilderness
Another bullet hole

Playing it all for gods
Yesterday

Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
Every day, I look out on the bus
Silver lining's getting lost

Floated out into the woods
To hear the old elk call
Touched a rainbow with my hands
I'm dry, I got 'em all
"Ride on," said the king of cool
You've got nothing to lose
Tinseltown is down the road
It's the bullet or the noose

If you're playing it all for gods
Far away

Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
And every day, I look out of the bus
Silver lining's getting lost

Carnival

We play to win, just to find the dark
Go home again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing
Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
I hear the music in the background
Singing, singing

Oh, I haven't see the glory
Coming, coming, coming
And we play
We play, we play, we play like a

Just like a carnival
Game, just like a carnival
Laugh, just like a carnival
Joke, just like a
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival

We play to win, just to find the dark
Go again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing

We, just like a carnival
We laughed, just like a carnival
Sleep with the dead, just like a carnival
Playing with your mind, just like a
Spinning me round and around and around

Ayy, look, yo, no castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
And Mummy ain't said "Honey, I shrunk the kids" yet
I ain't Jesus, but I'm walking on water
There's no bombs here, there's no war, 'cause
I can break out of jail with a lighter
So is there any point in making laws, blud?
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore
No rain, condoms it poured
And up the road, you'd never guess who I saw

Uh, uh, uh, it's K-A
Look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym (Yeah)
Honey, I'm home this is where I wanna live (Yeah)
Just found it like Nemo on the D-low
I don't know if it's greener, but it's green though
On the other side of the fence, bye to the ends
Look, no feds, no stress, no rent
No superficial shit, this real flow
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold
And the speech goes like, "Hi, little lady
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby?"
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy
Swagger on a hundred degrees, no eighty
Look, if heaven had a VIP
Uh, this is it: white sand, blue sea
But I don't know who they are
And I'm damn sure they don't know me, but I come in peace

Cool! White flag! White flag!
Uh-huh, no war! No guns! No corps!
Just life, just love, no hype, just fun
No ties, just me and my mind
Just me and my wife, but tell me if I'm dreamin'
'Cause I don't wanna wake up till the evenin'
And I don't wanna be left sleepin'
From all the diseases that I breathe in
Look, respect the island, no stealin'
And don't bring religion here, no three kings
Integrated, and we ain't leavin'!
We come on a peace t'ing
White Flag? White Flag!

Revolving doors, what have I done?
Someone on the TV, a tepid loss
Revolving doors, what will I become?
A redneck song
Paid up for seven
But he only got an eight now, now
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I see no wrong in here

On a foggy day
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I sit in a diner and the Beatles play
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I'm paid up for a seven
But I only got S.O. eight, oh, now
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I seem to run out here
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Revolving doors
It's stormy on the Eastern Seaboard
He got silver up his nose

He paid up for three
But got only two

(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Then he said
Seems I was born for this
Seems I was born to this

Lord hear me now
Junk boats and English boys
Crashing out in super marts
Electric fences and guns
You swallow me
I'm a pill on your tongue
Here on the nineteenth floor
The neon lights make me calm
And late in a star's life
It begins to explode
And all the people in a dream
Wait for the machine
To pick the shit up, leave it clean
Kid, hang over here
What you learning in school?
Is the rise of an Eastern sun
Gonna be good for everyone?
The radio station disappears
Music turning to thin air
The DJ was the last to leave
She had well conditioned hair
Was beautiful, but nothing really was there

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Yeah, wah gwaan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains undercover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover

Like a chameleon, see a change in your color
Crabs in the barrel, wanna hate on each other
So my life gets better, whatever the weather
I dance in the rain and I bathe in summer
It's the black Corleone in the button-up shirt
Before we take off you better buckle up first
Fresher than the President, psychedelics got me in my element
All negativity, that's irrelevant
Amber Leaf or ganja leaf, I back strap when I wrap the sheets
Now I feel to go for a drive, so I grab my keys
Shades on, roof down, tryna catch a breeze
Ridin' 'round the hood, got the Devil in my ear
Can you smell that? Smells like jealousy in the air
Don't know who they're tryna scare
Looked at the man in the mirror, that's the only enemy that I fear
A zombie knows who to frighten
Just know I love the action, but I move in silence
And, right now, I'm just takin' what's mine 'till Elizabeth returns to diamonds

Wah gwaan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains undercover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover

Tryna be the boss of life, gets tougher
I hope you're ready for the truth that you're gonna discover
Always gonna be a Judas at the Last Supper
Stay woke, it's a rocky road on the come-up
I take the shots like Scorsese
More money, more problems and more ladies
Everyday somebody die, still, mothers give birth to more babies
The Earth spins, the world gets more crazy
You gotta have a suit for the christening
A suit for the wedding and a suit for the court case
Probably wear the same suit to the funeral
Tryna see the bigger picture, man, it's bigger than the portrait
Bigger than me, no, you can't fight of your demons with vitamin C
Have to open your mind, use your vision and see
Keep your eyes on the prize so vigilantly
Love how you live, remember the world, full of expensive shit
Can't forget the poor 'cause you're friends with the rich
Stay true to the mold, I ain't ever gonna switch

Yeah, yeah-yeah, wah gwaan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains undercover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover

Hm, who's that pressin' on the buzzer?
Better check the camera, you don't wanna get stuck up
You listen close, you can hear death around the corner
One wrong move and we're all gonna suffer

Ahh, ehn, oya
E dide, ero re, oya
E dide, ero re, oya
E dide, ero re, oya
E dide, ero re, E dide

How far, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains undercover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover

Every sound
Every sound from everyone, receiving you
Everyone, receiving you
Anyone
Not anyone of us who is in search
Everyone's receiving you
Come by the long way
Deep in the summer day
I'll be there with you
(That's where I heard it for myself)
On the training ground
For the new world
You heard it too
 
   <|endoftext|>   
 
Try to see myself what goes on
Make it up myself, I'll never
Always told my thoughts aloud
Then another day I shut up

Back to the sand
Doing what you can
Bound to be gone
Damned a loser

Found out right then they were fed up
Cause everybody said to shut up

Yeah!

Thought that you might care what goes on
Try to say "what up?"; I'm fed up
Everybody said I shoot up
But I just gotta tell them what up?

Down with the sun
I knew that I was done
Did it to my self
Did it to my self, and then

Everybody's stirring shit up
Cause everybody tells me "shut up"

Ohh
Dream on my world
I live on my world
Going out my head, down to somewhere
Goin' on a dance hall tune
In a pressure today
I blew a bad man away today
Had a gun, had to be done
I blew a man away

Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet, yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep


Dream on the street
People passing through me, yes, they do
Want mine back. I want my heart mend?
I'm gonna bring it all back

Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet yeah
They might promise you

And we're running through life's cycles
This is the ego shaking
We need to escalate it
We're only halfway to the lover waiting

Halfway, halfway to the halfway house
We're not takers

We're feeling the same chill
It's giving momentum
We're feeling the same thrill
Whatever we do, trust
Imagine a broadcast, the central in mountain
You say that you want your cherryade fountain

Shit  night life

My world seems open
Every satellite up here is watching
But I was here from the very start
Trying to find a way to your heart

All the days of forgetting
They've gone out with the tide
Lost at sea somewhere, waiting
Like setting suns at the rodeo
Trying to find someone you'll never know

Oh, sinking love
On the cloud of unknowing
Every satellite up here is watching
Waiting to see what the morning brings
May bring sunshine on its wings

When you're smoking tin foil in the morning
It's gonna be a cold day
When you're keeping everything inside you
It can only hurt you
Unrelated sounds
The sun will shine again
You hold it in your hands
This land is a young land let it stay that way
Its pollution only turns you into
Something you don't want to see in the water
A reflection of them that you receive
You don't own the sun
And the sun won't shine again
So maybe you're all in love
With aluminium

The cling and a clang
Is the metal in my head when I walk
I hear a sort of, this tinging noise
Cling clang
The cling clang
So many things happen while walking
The metal in my head clangs and clings as I walk
Freaks my balance out
So the natural thought
Is just clogged up
Totally clogged up
So we need to unplug these dams
And make the natural flow
It sort of freaks me out
We need to unplug the dams
You cannot stop the natural flow of thought
With a cling and a clang

And wake me up again until
We're Aluminium
You hold it in your hands
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again

Some of us will never sleep again

She gave me a call
That brought me back
That brought me back
Back, back, back, back
The elevator
(Too late)
The new world
I just wanted to be close to you
(Close to you)
The new world
I'm tired
Seems like I was alright again
That brought me back
I just wanted to be close to you

Talk to me
Roger that!
Roger that!
I don't have to take this any further if you don't want me to
I only go as far as you want me to
That's as only as far as I go

People, people
Everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people
Everybody people
Everybody standing their ground

If you dream to the top
You'll be over the edge
If you get it on side
You'll be taking a ditch
You'll be loving our love
But you don't know why
It's the term of the day
So we never excite
If your heart isn't there
So you might as well say
"I know it, I got it but I know that time will set me together"
