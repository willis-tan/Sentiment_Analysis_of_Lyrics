city's breaking down on a camel's back
they just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
so while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
you won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
you got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
a melancholy town where we never smile
and all i wanna hear is the message beep
my dreams, they got a kissing 'cause i don't get to sleep, no
(*beep*)
windmill, windmill for the land
turn forever, hand in hand
take it all in on your stride
it is ticking, falling down
love forever, love has freely
turned forever, you and me
windmill, windmill for the land
is everybody in?
laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
linin' 'em up like ass cracks
play these ponies at the track

with yo' sound, you in the blink
gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
with yo' sound, you kill the inc.
so don't stop, get it, get it (get it)
until you're cheddar headed
and watch the way i navigate, hahahahaha
(ha! haha! haha! haha! ha!)

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
finally, someone let me out of my cage
now, time for me is nothing, 'cause i'm countin' no age
nah, i couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
i'm good at repairs, and i'm under each snare
intangible, bet you didn't think, so i command you to
panoramic view, look, i'll make it all manageable
pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
picture you getting down in a picture tube
like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
mystical? maybe, spiritual hero
who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
priceless to you, because i put you on the hype shit
you like it? gun smokin', righteous with one toke
get psychic among those, possess you with one dose
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on (that's right)
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
the essence, the basics, without it, you make it
allow me to make this childlike in nature
rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
i'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
i see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (that's right)
from this fuckin' enterprise, now i'm sucked into your lies
through russel, not his muscles
but percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
that's the inner (fuck 'em) so i'ma stick around with russ and be a mentor
bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
where the thought is, i brought all this
so you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
no squealing and remember that it's all in your head
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future
is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on

up on melancholy hill, there's a plastic tree
are you here with me?
just looking out on the day of another dream
where you can't get what you want, but you can get me
so let's set out to sea, love
'cause you are my medicine when you're close to me
when you're close to me
so call in the submarines, 'round the world we'll go
does anybody know her
if we're looking out on the day of another dream?
if you can't get what you want, then come with me
up on melancholy hill
sits the manatee, love
just looking out for the day when you're close to me
when you're close to me
when you're close to me
when the pulsing looks to die for
take it in your heart now, lover
when the case is out
and tired and sodden
take it in your heart
take it in your heart
back to when it was cool
'cause there's no substitute
who even knows the truth?
the truth, the truth
take it in your heart now, love her
take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
take it in your heart
take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
where it all goes down
outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
i took it to the right man
took it all back
when the courts were closing
it was bobby gracing
i know that
i put it to the right man
he put it back
talk to the crowds
stacks of lights
come streaming back
make it for the best times
growing pains, good times
good times, good times
good times, good times
good times, good times
take it in your heart now, love her
take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
take it in your heart
take it in your heart
where it all goes down

calling the world from isolation
'cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
and if you're coming back to find me
you'd better have good aim
shoot it true, i need you in the picture
that's why i'm calling you
(calling you) i'm the lonely twin, the left hand
reset myself and get back on track
i don't want this isolation
see the state i'm in now?
calling the hunter with the rifle
'cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
shoot it true, i want you in the picture
that's why i'm calling you
(calling you) i'm the lonely twin, the left hand
reset myself and get back on track
i don't want this isolation
see the state i'm in now?
if i pick it up when i know that it's broken
do i put it back?
or do i head out onto the lonesome trail
and let you down?
i'm the lonely twin, the left hand

(and let you down?)

or do i head out onto the lonesome trail
and let you go?
slow it down some, no split, clown bum
your gold hits sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
where you found them at?
got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it
would have floated, bloated, voted
sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
that blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
crank it on blast, roll past front street
blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
these kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?
something has started today
where did it go? what you want it to be?
well you know, november has come
when it's gone away
(oh, what they say)
something has started today
where did it go? what you want it to be?
well you know, november has come
when it's gone away
bah, can you dig it like a spigot?
my guess is yes you can, like can i kick it, wicked,
liquor shot if you happy and you know it
as you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
grope a pen and i'm in cope hymen
doper rhymin' more worther than the hope diamond
acquired off the black market
a wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
the rapid-fire spark lit (zzzt!) a rapper bug zapper
and it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
the beats got family members askin' him for closure
aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em clean it
then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
she wore a filled-in thong of billabong
that said "nah fo'real-a, the villain on a gorilla jawn?"

i need a gun to keep myself among
the poor people are burning in the sun
but they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
i need a gun 'cause all i do is dance
'cause all i do is dance
i need a gun to keep myself among
the poor people are burning in the sun
but they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
i need a gun 'cause all i do is dance
'cause all i do is dance
in my backpack, i got my act right in case you act quite difficult
and your result weaken
with anger and discontent some are seeking
and in search of like nimoy
i'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
i change your whole location to a pine box, six under
impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
orders given to me is strike and i'm thunder
with lightning-fast reflexes
on constant alert from the constant hurt
that seems limitless with no drop in pressure
it seems like everybody's out to test ya, 'till they see you break
you can't conceal the hate that consumes you
i'm the reason why you fill up your isuzu
chill with your old lady at the tilt
i got a ninety-day extension and i'm filled with guilt
from things that i seen
your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
at night i hear the shots ring, so i'm a light sleeper
the cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
out in the desert with my street sweeper
"the war is over", so said the speaker
with the flight suit on
maybe to him, i'm just a pawn
so he can advance
remember when i used to dance?
man, all i wanna do is dance
i need a gun to keep myself among
mama mavis, oh, mama, they tried my patience
{obama} is gone, who is left to save us?
{orlando,} we mourn, i'm praying for my neighbors
they say the devil's at work and {trump} is calling favors
you say i'm dangerous, i speak for the nameless
i fly with the vultures, i be with them bangers
if change don't come, then the change won't come
if the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
(woo!)
am i passin' into the light?
(am i looking into mercy's eyes?)
look into your eyes
all the world is out of your hands
(then ascending into the dark, let me out)
you got to die a little if you wanna live
change come to pass
change come to pass
you'd best be ready for it
something i've begun to fear is about to change its form
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
but i won't get tired at all
let me out
let me out
let me out
let me out
look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
tell me that i won't die at the hands of the police
promise me i won't outlive my nephew and my niece
promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that i teach
tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
but until then, i keep my piece in arm's reach
am i passin' into the light?
(am i looking into mercy's eyes?)
all the world is out of your hands
(then ascending into the dark) another night
you got to die a little if you wanna live
change coming
you'd best be ready for it
something i've begun to fear is about to change its form
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
but i won't get tired at all

summer don't know me no more
he got mad, that's all
summer don't know me
he'd just let me low in myself
'cause i do know love
from you then, just dying
i saw that day
lost my mind
lord, i'm fine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
don't stop the bud, when it comes
it's the dawn, you'll see
money won't get there
ten years passed tonight, you'll flee
if you do that
i'll be sworn
to find you
i saw that day
lost my mind
lord, i'm fine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
i saw that day
lost my mind
lord, i'm fine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
(i saw that day)
(lost my mind)
(lord, i’m fine)
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
i'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
with a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
i'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
the shadow in the corner, just playing along
i'm only laying in my bed, i'm rolling aside
but if i get a car, i'm hoping to ride
because i know if i ever say "i'm leaving" to you
you've gotta volunteer, and you don't know what to do
you're soft
you wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (alright, how are we doin'?)
and if you're thinking that i don't know what you're thinking, baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you do more thinking and i'll go out and make it alright (alright, how do you do?)
i’m impregnable, incredible, the setting of quo
i’m at lay chimirida, not a heart and soul
i got a saturday night, and nothing is dead
and if i ever had to do it, well, you know i wouldn’t care
i just kicked down, i love when i’m seen
yeah, and if i wanna talk back, the message is free
then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
and if you get popped here, you get ‘em a lot
you get a heart, break
you wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (alright, how are we doin'?)
and if you're thinking that i don't know what you're thinking, baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you do more thinking and i'll go out and make it alright (alright, how do you do?)
every time we try, we get nowhere
wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? yeah
trying so hard to act like we don't care
but it's true, you do, nothing is left
so i guess i'm right
new word, onomatopoeia (boom)
quit actin' like you don't wanna be here
fuck around and get jumped like leap year
glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
get the fuck on, gone
okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
my girl look pretty up there riding dick
my plaid past, my solid future
asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
i'm an outkast but you're into me
summer got mad cause the winter blew me
that juicy fruit, that splooshy sploosh
generation x on bloopty bloop
get duked, gotta get duked, the duke
everybody hit the floor, we through the roof

a lava language in a vocal volcanic
if it ain't fixed, don't broke it, don't panic
if it ain't this, it ain't shit, goddamn it
if it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush
and if it ain't hip, it don't hop, well then hush

every time we try, we get nowhere
wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? yeah
trying so hard to act like we don't care (i don't care)
but it's true, you do, nothing is left
so i guess i'm right
flip the page, our days are revelatious
space is strange, doctor, i've got no patience
oh, it's all a part of the process (okay, okay)
nothing's new, it's true, cool, i admit
shit, i guess you're right
the world is spinning too fast
i'm buying lead nike shoes
to keep myself tethered
to the days i've tried to lose
my mama said to slow down

stop dancing to the music
of gorillaz in a happy mood

they do the bump

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
momentary bliss
we could do so much better than this
mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
we could do so much better than this
oh, rita, oh, rita
lovely rita, meter maid
lovely rita, meter maid
you're potential, you lack credentials
and you are special, so fucking special (rita)
oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
and you keep squeezing the truth from the middle (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
you parted seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (ah)
and you was gaggin' for some gags and now you're rollin' (woo)
best you shut your trap and keep it hush (hush)
on another note, compliments make me blush
there's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
cavern of your mind, you say your pattern
you pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say: (ah, ah, ah)
"what was scripted, the day before it happened?"
we all give applause when people open doors
but on the way out and get your back in
see, everything in life ain't silver and gold
but minin' for metal gave you platinum
it makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
it's wearing thin to think light bulb don't blink
just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
you're a turkey twizzler, you deserve school dinners
makes me sick
poster boy (ayy)
poster girl (rita)
truth, the bills (the bills)
must be paid (yeah, yeah, alright)
poster boy (yeah, alright)
poster girl (ah, that's time)
in truth, the bills, they must be paid (uh-huh)
and what is left is sodding atypical
all you need to change your face
you're gettin' sold, you're such a waste
you know, we could do so much better than this
swimmin' in pools of momentary bliss
where you gotta find a family 'cause everybody taken
they worry you keep on adding
i think you gotta crawl
it makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
it's wearing thin, to think light bulb don't blink
just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
you're a turkey twizzler, you deserve school dinners
it makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
it's wearing thin, to think light bulbs don't blink
just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
you're a turkey twizzler, you deserve school dinners
makes me sick
we could do so much better than this
mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
we could do so much better than this
oh, rita, oh, rita
we could do so much better than this
perfect little pictures of moments that we missed
we could do so much better than this
oh, rita, oh, rita
i'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
that you made with plastic power
your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
drive on engines till they weep
with future pixels in factories far away
so call the mainland from the beach
your heart is now washed up in bleach
the waves are rising for this time of year
and nobody knows what to do with the heat
under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
while rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky
(uh)
(mmmmm)
i can't see you now my heart is frozen
all the bowses and the growses
have been abstinated in my soul
i prayed on the immovable
yet clinging to the atoms of rock
seasons see adjustment signs of change
i can't see now, she said, "taxi"
now that light is all i can take
this dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
i'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
that you made with plastic power
your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
(here we go again)
that's electric
(uh)
that's electric
helicopters fly over the beach
same time every day, same routine
a clear target in the summer when skies are blue
it's part of the noise when winter comes
it reverberates in my lungs
nature's corrupted in factories far away
(here we go again)
that's electric
your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
that's electric
with future pixels in factories far away
(here we go again)
that's electric
your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
that's electric
with future pixels in factories far away
(here we go again)
okay, last time
this is drugs
this is your brain on drugs

with a basin on my head

and i take five to get it to load in
even in the place
and i get my jeans on right
and sit in the rows and
inside, i live in a cage and i
peek out and summon the code
and i enter the lake to face what i'm cagin'
gone with the self of the day, gone
with the self of the day, gone
(yeah, i get myself upright)

oscillate yourself tonight
when you're in your bed
simulate the dopamine
passing through your head
when you get back on a saturday night
and the room is caving in
do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?
see yourself in cupid's lake
chipped in your head
do you indicate to satellites
passing by the edge?
when you get back on a saturday night
and your head is caving in
do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?
do you dance like this forever?
do you look like me?
do you burn like me?

oh, joys are us, the sun has come again to hold you
sailing out the doldrums of the week
the polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you
it's all around you, out here
and if the whole world is crashing down (on you)
fall through space out of mind with me
where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
blows all the shadows far away
the falling of the whole empire, is here to hold you
rolling out and haunted till it sleeps
little memories, marching on
your little feet, working the machine
say will it spin, will it soar?
my little dream, working the machine
soon, like a wave, empires will fall
and closing in on you, they're going on
little memories
your little feet, working the machine
say will it spin, will it soar?
my little dream, working the machine
soon like a wave, empires will fall
closing in on you, they're going on
where does it come from?
when everything was outside
busted and blue
how in the universe?
through the lithium
busted and blue
i was asked by a computer
a shadow on the wall
an image made by virgil
to rule over us all
so amplify the sirens
and to find real amends
i'm through the echo-chambers
to other worlds i went
all my life
all my life
beam a light on me
i am a satellite
and i can't get back without you
be my love
be my love
be my light
be my light
where do they come from?
the wires that connect to us
weightless and fall on your body
'til we're invisible
i'm with you through altitudes
busted and blue
all my life
all my life
beam a light on me
i am a satellite
and i can't get back without you
be my love
be my love
be my light
be my light
busted and blue

i sense the need in her grammar
her nose has never been skatin' (uh-huh)
but she's sippin' star constellation (shit)
for real, her squirt game was so like 2pac out of court run towards camera (uh-huh)
my response to that was just, "check please"
fuck that, my man, you can't let these (moments)
pass you by like "tick tock"
so i'm smackin' the bottom like flip flops
made her alarm ring (she screams)
and now we done, we passed the test
so now lay down to rest
and wait for the mornin' hangover that comes

here is our tree
that primitively grows
and when you go to bed
scarecrows from the far east
come to eat
its tender fruits
and i thought the best way to perfect our tree
is by building walls
walls like unicorns
in full glory and galore
and even stronger
than the walls of jericho
but glad then my friend
out in the field, we shall reap a better day
what we have always dreamt of having
are now for the starving
it is love, that is the root of all evil
but not our tree
and thank you, my friend
for trusting me
hallelujah

how will we know?
when the morning comes
we are still human
how will we know?
how will we dream?
how will we love?
how will we know?
don't worry, my friend
if this be the end, then so shall it be
until we say so, nothing will move
ah, don't worry
it's not against our morals
it's legally tender
touch, my friend
while the whole world
and whole beasts of nations desire
power
when the morning comes
we are still human
how will we know?
how will we dream?
how will we love?
how will we know?

my face will be painted in these white brick lines
'cause all my fears invaded
all the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
living on the limits
and if you say goodbye too many times
the sentinels will find me and switch me off this time
'cause all my fear's evaded
all the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
living on the limits
if all you ever get from the summit is the count of the fall of man
every call and cost made to your heart
you were in the kind of game that put the force in me
i was ever chasing fireflies
sometimes i follow a firefly
it takes me into the night
baby, i just survive
i'm love drunk, i'm sorry
am i losing you?

waiting on the planet to turn to me, dark side
if loving you's a felony now, then i'm a renegade, riding
trying to find tomorrow ain't easy 'til you dive in
swimming pools
why you rolling waves over me now, that's all i need, dreaming
waiting on la to come find me, be forgiven
i'll be a regular guy for you, i never said i'd do that
why you looking so beautiful to me now when you so sad?
i will always think about you
that's why i'm calling you back on my way through
i wanna stay with you for a long time; i wanna be stone, love
i wanna see la in your eyes when i'm leaving with your love

pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
we're here tonight for a very special offering
an offering of our spirits this evening in unison
but first, a word of instruction
hello, hello
please leave all your belongings at the door
you can sit or stand, we can take a vote
and just tiptoe to the centre of the circle
while we unveil the ropes
still a little room left to hang your clothes
some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
ready, set, go
i lock hands with yours
we dive into the floor (drop)
when we reach the core
then we stomp some more (drop)
i lock hands with yours
and then we dive down into the floor
seven thousand miles 'til we reach the core
and then we circle back and we stomp some more, got it?
it's just like that
you promise all your life, then you turn your back
you glide across the space, and diagonal past
then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
you move your hips and your arms like a cat
spin three times, and you're back where you're at
does anybody catch what any of this is about?
no? well, work it out
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
okay, slide like a lizard, walk like a crab
eyes dilated, dark to the grass
then when you find you're invisible, you melt into a puzzle
keep it flowing like the rivers do
you gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
and if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
don't take the chance, not worth the risk
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
who knows?
there's always stains on what's real and true
tonight is a special, special occasion
and all that's left for us to do, is move
ooh, i, i
where am i going?
what am i doing?
i, i'm alive
alive
i can fly
i, i'm so alive
i'm so, i'm so high
(everybody)
everybody says i'm busted and blue
i feel better when i don't need that
everybody gonna funk the night
it's so big, big, big
everybody says that i'm more
feelin' out of body, i'm drinkin' it up
can i tell you what the dream's about tonight?
(dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright)
this morning, you've got time for a hot home cooked breakfast
delicious and piping hot in only three microwaved minutes
are you kidding?!
yo, pretty packages of frosted delights
(look, it comes with a toy! i like that)
(i wanna number four, number six, and throw in a plastic donut)
just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken
rappers of many bite sizes
(man, are you freaking blind
that's a rock)
all mixed in the pot full
momma's homemade from scratch, but (not quite)
toasted over flames they be tasting (quite right)
all hail king neptune and his water-breathers
no snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
"don't waste time" with your net
our net worth is set
ready, go many know others but
we be the colors of the mad and the wicked
we be bad, we re-brick it
with the twenty-four hour sign
shower mine habits
while you dine like rabbits
with the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(oh that's chicken)
gotta have it super fast

aries
i'm looking out at a volcano
trying to read the world today and see where you're at
i'll never do that
i'm a model that is uncomplicated
you can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'cause then i am silenced
i'm standing on a beach in the distance
and even though you're far away, can you see my red light?
it's waiting to turn green
'cause i feel so isolated without you
i can't play a happy tune on my own, so stay by my side
high or low tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
and it feels like i'm falling in, again
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
feels like i'm falling in, again
i'm a model that is uncomplicated
you can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'cause then i am silenced
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
and it feels like i'm falling in, again
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
feels like i'm falling in, again
don't try to hide away
you know you've been on
though i'm keeping calm, i'm not on
go away, my love
thought i could change our fate
i tried again, but this delay
it's more than i can take
and it got to me
when you state your love
and you walk away
what could you be on?
now you're not around
but i hope you see
i will be full-on
if it's up to me
it's all i got
feels so good doing me
if you take a look at the time you took and move on
but don't go too far, my lover
we could try harder, baby
there's gotta be a better way
so much that we could make it
and it got to me
when you state your love
but you run away
what could you be on?
now you're not around
but i hope you see
gotta be full-on
it is up to me
it's all i got
it's all i got
it's all i got
it's all i got
wish i could think of better ways
'cause i lost my patience yesterday
if you could see inside of me
there'd be no heart on my x-ray
opponents tryna checkmate
but i don't see no escape
just tryna keep my head straight
on thin ice with the ice skates
at times, i feel like givin' up
'cause it feels like i've had enough
felt like my soul in handcuffs
got questions with no answers
can't help me out, i need a friend
i'm losin' faith in this world of sin
tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
it's like a cycle that never ends
i can't contend with no handlin'
i can't take care of no grown man
all by myself, cryin' for help
but won't get saved by no superman
all comes down to the mighty dollar
greed and lust, abusin' power
clock is tickin', hour after hour
makes me wanna throw my hands and holler
and you got to me
when you state your love
but you run away
what could you be on?
now you're not around
but i hope you see
gotta be full-on
it is up to me
everybody's here with me
we've got no camera to see
don't think i'm all in this world
the camera won't let me roll
the verdict doesn't love our soul
the digital won't let me go
yeah, yeah, yeah, i'll pay
when tomorrow
tomorrow comes today
stereo, i want it on
it's taken me far too long
don't think i'm all in this world
don't think i'll be here too long
don't think i'll be here too long, no
(don't think i'll be here too long)
i don't think i'll be here too long
(i don't think i'll be here too long)

once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
there was a town where the people known as happyfolk lived
their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
obscured as it was by great clouds
here they played out their peaceful lives
innocent of the litany of excess and violence
that was growing in the world below
to live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called monkey was enough
then one day, strangefolk arrived in the town
they came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses
but no one noticed them, they only saw shadows
you see, without the truth of the eyes, the happyfolk were blind
falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head
now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
the dance of the dead, the dance of the dead
in time, strangefolk found their way into the high reaches of the mountain
and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable, sincerity and beauty
by chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
the strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
and soon they began to mine the mountain
its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world
meanwhile, down in the town, the happyfolk slept restlessly
their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
and as the strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear
bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the monkey
for the first time
the happyfolk felt fearful
for they knew that soon the monkey would stir from its deep sleep
and then came a sound, distant first
it grew into castrophany
so immense it could be heard far away in space
there were no screams, there was no time
the mountain called monkey had spoken, there was only fire
and then...nothing
o little town in u.s.a., your time has come to see
there's nothing you believe you want
but where were you when it all came down on me?
did you call me? no...
to the dark, dark seas
comes the only whale
watching ships go by
it's the day we try
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio on a plastic beach
it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
it's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio
did they haul you out
on a really hot day?
when the call got made
you had gone away
from us
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio on a plastic beach
it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
it's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio
casio, casio, casio and green, green glow
casio, casio, casio, green, green glow
casio, casio, casio and green, green glow
casio, casio, casio
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio on a plastic beach
it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
it's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio
plastico, plastico, plastico where the green, green grows
plastico, plastico, plastico
plastico, plastico, plastico where the green, green grows
plastico, plastico, plastico
waiting by the mailbox, by the train
passin' by the hills 'til i hear the name
i'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all i want is
someone to rely on as thunder comes a-rolling down
someone to rely on as the lightning comes a-staring in again
i'll wait to be forgiven, maybe i never will
my star has left me to take the bitter pill
that shattered feeling, well, the cause of it's a lesson learned
"just don't know if i could roll into the sea again
just don't know if i could do it all again," she said—it's true
waiting in my room, and i lock the door
i watch the coloured animals across the floor
and i'm looking from a distance and i'm listening to the whispers
and oh, it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling
and you're falling in and caught again
cau-au-au-aught again
i'm caught again in the mystery
you're by my side, but are you still with me?
the answer's somewhere deep in it, i'm sorry but you're feeling it
but i just have to tell you that i love you so much these days
have to tell you that i love you so much these days, it's true
my heart is in economy
due to this autonomy
rolling in and caught again
cau-au-au-aught again
cau-au-au-aught again
(cau-au-au-aught again)
my heart is in economy
due to this autonomy (cau-au-au-aught again)
rolling in and caught again
cau-au-au-aught again
distant stars
come in black or red
i've seen their worlds
inside my head
they connect
with the fall of man
they breathe you in
then dive as deep as they can
there's nothing you can do for them
they are the force between
when the sunlight is arising
there's nothing you can say to him
he is in outer heart
and the space has been broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
is it far away
in the glitter freeze
or in our eyes
every time they meet
it's by the light
of the plasma screens
we keep switched on
all through the night while we sleep
there's nothing you can do for them
they are the force between
when the sunlight is arising
there's nothing you can say to her
i am without a heart
and the space has been broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
where the beautiful people at?
i said where the beautiful people at?
beautiful people, clap your hands (yeah)
freaky people, clap your hands
geeky people, clap your hands

it's my mistake, i'll make it
j-dub to the boom now make it
bounce, wiggle, bounce, wiggle
shakin' all them bangs out
chemical cutthroats, bound to blow the brain out
cut to the brain, this ain't no game
i'll show no shame, i'll birth this blame
i'm twisted cain, i'll twist a-gain
i'll push the blade, as plain as day
known to what these sayers say
known to what these doers do
it's you and who and you-know-where
we's about to take it there
we's about to make it clear, we happy or we lonesome

walk through you (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
walk through you
walk through you
walk through you
walk through you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
walk through you
walk through you
walk through you
walk through you

o green world
don't desert me now
bring me back to fallen town
where someone is still alive
fighting for something new in this
when no one needs the heart of me
and i'm looking out somewhere i've never been before
been before
o green world
don't desert me now
made of you and you of me
but where are we?
oh no, sells to lie
from the darkest stars that force you
down when you’re in first
does it seem so little to you?
i know you now, i know
you know me too
you know me too
hope, sex and drugs thrust into myself holy
it feels holy
it’s fun when you’re the father and in the place you were
i'm not gonna cry
i've got more time to give
i'm not gonna cry
find another dream
am i incapable of healing
the memory of my fall from grace in your heart
i'm on my journey home
with no fuel alone
i think i'll coast a while
i'm not gonna cry
i've got more time to give
i'm not gonna cry
find another dream
'cause i'm about to solve it
put my engine back into overdrive
so i can breathe again, (photo) photosynthesize again (synthesize)
with the green hills of my home
i'm not gonna cry
i've got more time to give
i'm not gonna cry
find another dream
i'm not gonna cry
(pave the way to me)
i got more time to give
(it's getting nasty)
i'm not gonna cry
find another dream
but if i got it right, you'd tell me
and if i was wrong, then i'd disappear
but i'm incapable
i'm not gonna cry
(pave the way to me)
i got more time to give
(it's getting nasty)
i'm not gonna cry
find another dream
got off a plane to the countryside
i drove to the mountain and a hole in the ground
there was crack on the corner and someone dead
and fire coming out of the monkey's head
don't get lost in heaven
they got locks on the gate
don't go over the edge
you'll make a big mistake
put me in a cab to suburbia
i just took a line but it wasn't with you
there was more of it there, when i got back home
but you'd left me, you don't know my soul...
you're a hoe, girl
yeah, you're a hobo
don’t get lost in heaven
they got locks on the gate
don’t go over the edge, hey
you’ll make a big mistake
aaah-ahhh, you’ll make a big mistake
aaah-ahhh, you’ll make a big mistake
aaah-ahhh, you’ll make a big mistake
aaah-ahhh, you’ll make a big mistake
aaah-ahhh
some kind of nature
some kind of soul
some kind of mixture
some kind of gold
some kind of majesty
some chemical load
some kind of metal
made up from glue
some kind of plastic
i could wrap around you
the needy eat man-mades
they wear phony clothes
they sit with barbiturates
until they grow old
some kind of nature
some kind of soul
some kind of mixture
some kind of gold
some kind of majesty
some chemical load
well, me, i like plastics
and digital foils
to wrap up the sound
and protect the girls
from the spiritual poison
you spill at night
like phony clothes but
i really like mine
some kind of nature
some kind of nature
some kind of soul
come forth within us
oh lord, forgive me
some kind of mixture
some kind of gold
it's gonna come and find us
all we are is dust
some kind of metal, some kind of metal
made up from glue, made up from glue
some kind of plastic, some kind of plastic
i could wrap around you
the needy eat man-mades
they wear phony clothes
they sit with barbiturates
until they grow old
some kind of nature
some kind of nature

are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls?
take a gun, or how you say
that's no way
to behave
you’re just alone when you begin
to sing a song that doesn’t sin
it grows (hey) you know
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls?
are we the last to get away?
to a sun another day?
or do we know
well, we know
it doesn't seem to be conveyed that way
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls?
get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up...
lord, save me
'cause all i've sung
i got it down and wrong
i've seen myself today
 the lord, seeing all now
can we take a sound?
i bought the car and all
the coldest man doesn't say it's wrong
we go to the car
i see you walk into the fog
and when you get there do you see?
you see the last, it's you and me
'cause we're the last living souls
we're the last living souls
yeah, we're the last living souls
we're the last living souls
is it resolution?
or black and white flying balloons?
floating off, too colourful
or is it separation
you put it to your counting sand
waiting for the world to start again?
ticker tape
ticker tape
tick-tick-ticker tape
is this how you're feeling?
falling with the world tonight
cauterized and beautiful
slide the light
is this how you're healing?
out there in the paradigm
waiting for a cavalcade to come again
ticker tape
ticker tape
tick-tick-ticker tape
ticker tape
black light glints with colour
sudden long and horizontal outlines the star
a sudden draft and quick chill
a single snowflake falls
and that is all
that is all
the world's face hidden under folding wing
waiting for the world to start again
waiting for the world to start again
waiting for the world to start again
waiting for the world... again
'cause we're working through it
working through your nightmare
watch the worker bees
as they're working for it
working through the night shift
and i'm working through it
working through the nightmare
watch the worker bees
as they're working for it
working through the night shift
are you leaving for the rest of it?
coming back to ghosts inside
or is it just too late for that?
and i'm hoping for a little juice
déjalo
si quieres continuar, hermano
sal, ilumina tu vida
todo el cielo aplastándote
dime qué harás
enfréntalo
ilumina ese amor
antes que se vaya
algo siempre te entristece
cuando todo va bien
¿qué pasa contigo?
¿qué pasa contigo?
déjalo
si quieres continuar
no ocultes tu alma al sol
tienes una vida preciosa
de qué sirve si solo
muerte sobre media ciudad
¿qué pasa?
¿qué pasa contigo?
¿qué pasa contigo, mi hermano?
¿qué pasa contigo?
escucha a tu propia voz
salva tu amor
¿qué pasa contigo?
antes que se vaya
si todo va bien
¿qué pasa contigo?
¿qué pasa contigo?
mírate a ti mismo
enfréntalo
¿qué pasa contigo?
mi hermano
ven animate
¿qué pasa contigo?
oh, palace flows
rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
when the light shines through it i feel more exposed
will it ever change here? we'll just never know
stimulation, i'm in need of
see the time is of the essence and this clock doesn't own a home
rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
when the light shines through i feel more exposed
in tune, with myself on it, my mind is my weakness
with your strength, you might surprise yourself
never deny yourself, i live in the space is my thesis
i know you need this, i know you need this
i'm prone to run out of pieces
that might connect to something bigger
all in your mind, could follow me, you should consider
look at the time, i'm probably later than ever
"what did you find?" well come in here, and lit it with pressure
i look to the heavens and i saw open gates
i walked up and then i paused
what the fuck did you do this for?
wish me luck when that midnight falls
memories of a past life
can this be? this is our time, can this be? this is our time
come on
in stillness, known to the world, do you feel this?
trapped in my mind, hope i can find solitude
when connecting all of these pieces
i know you need this, i know you need this
i fold and unleash the beast
unknown is what i would be
if my whole purpose here wasn't to speak
now look at the time, i know that i am early today
what did you find when giving up and running away?
i gazed to the stars and this view can't be shared
when there are no other eyes in this room
mean the words when you sing your tune
free as a bird when i intake fumes
memories of this past life
can this be? this is our time, can this be? this is our time
come on
give up if you wanna survive
get oh so alive in your life
everything falling out the sky on top of you
now what you do?
set yourself up now
it's the love of your life
shallowly on me
all i know, before it's gone
i always feel it's getting you down
if nothing's wrong
what's the matter with me?
what's the matter with me?
give up if you wanna survive
pick the sound back up
you got to get on the song, lonely
what's the point?
it's funny 'til you're left to kill yourself
in this town
so what's the matter with me?
what's the matter with me?
what's the matter with me?
what's the matter with me?
i'm on the high ridge looking down
while we're evolving in it all
if i get back then i'll be grateful
look there's a billboard on the moon
let me take you this far
this crossing isn't much to me
there's lightning in the storm clouds
and i'll send you there to stay
you got me lost in magic city
you got me questioning it all
i hope that i make it home by wednesday
and this magic city lets me go
magic city
magic city
magic city
magic city
you put me up here in the penthouse
and painted me in red, white and blue
i filled the canyons with my ego
look there's a billboard on the moon
you got me lost in magic city
you got me questioning it all
i hope that i make it home by wednesday
and this magic city lets me go
hey
what is this drumming i'm hearing now?

all over me

okay
in the morning it came to me
build a tunnel from zurich to new york
i find it hard to share this with anyone
because even to me it sounded ridiculous
but one morning
after a long complicated night
i made my mind up, to share my vision with the world
everything that follows
i'm not responsible for
i landed on the silver lake
washed up and feeling blue
heard the sound of footsteps
drifting softly to the moon
looking for clear water
i had to take control
out there in the wilderness
another bullet hole
playing it all for gods
yesterday
idaho, idaho
there's a beauty on the road
every day, i look out on the bus
silver lining's getting lost
floated out into the woods
to hear the old elk call
touched a rainbow with my hands
i'm dry, i got 'em all
"ride on," said the king of cool
you've got nothing to lose
tinseltown is down the road
it's the bullet or the noose
if you're playing it all for gods
far away
idaho, idaho
there's a beauty on the road
and every day, i look out of the bus
silver lining's getting lost
carnival
we play to win, just to find the dark
go home again, and we both fall out
i wanna spend this time with you
doing nothing
keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
i hear the music in the background
singing, singing
oh, i haven't see the glory
coming, coming, coming
and we play
we play, we play, we play like a
just like a carnival
game, just like a carnival
laugh, just like a carnival
joke, just like a
spinning me round and around and around
just like a carnival
we play to win, just to find the dark
go again, and we both fall out
i wanna spend this time with you
doing nothing
we, just like a carnival
we laughed, just like a carnival
sleep with the dead, just like a carnival
playing with your mind, just like a
spinning me round and around and around
just like a carnival, yeah

(just like that) deep holin', click clackin', crack-a-lackin', full packin' (hey!), mo' stackin'
(just like that) actin' a fool when i teach

(just like that) mirror mirror on the wall, boss dogg, give it to 'em
(just like that) get involved, turn it up, speed it up
slow it up, underground where (just like that) the under us undercut
shipped up, shipped out, swimmin' with the sharks put my gills up
(just like that) turn the wheels up real tough
(just like that) drinkin' lemonade in the shade
getting blazed with a gang of pilgrims
(just like that) yeah, this my path
belly floppin' lockin' while i'm rockin' in the bubble bath
(just like that) and i'm just like math
fozo's added up that get you more cash
(just like that) so quick, so fast
all the kids say they love it when i make 'em laugh
(just like that, yeah) welcome to the world of the plastic beach, yeah
(just like that) welcome to the world of the plastic beach
(just like that) welcome to the world of the plastic beach, yeah
(just like that) welcome to the world of the plastic beach
welcome to the world of the plastic beach
ayy, look, yo, no castaway, no survivor
i ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
i feel small in this big wide world
and mummy ain't said "honey, i shrunk the kids" yet
i ain't jesus, but i'm walking on water
there's no bombs here, there's no war, 'cause
i can break out of jail with a lighter
so is there any point in making laws, blud?
this ain't atlantis, are you sure?
i nearly suffocated when i touched the shore
no rain, condoms it poured
and up the road, you'd never guess who i saw
uh, uh, uh, it's k-a
look, skip on the beat like ali in the gym (yeah)
honey, i'm home this is where i wanna live (yeah)
just found it like nemo on the d-low
i don't know if it's greener, but it's green though
on the other side of the fence, bye to the ends
look, no feds, no stress, no rent
no superficial shit, this real flow
where the women look hot, but the beach cold
and the speech goes like, "hi, little lady
sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby?"
word in the village, i'm a little bit crazy
swagger on a hundred degrees, no eighty
look, if heaven had a vip
uh, this is it: white sand, blue sea
but i don't know who they are
and i'm damn sure they don't know me, but i come in peace
cool! white flag! white flag!
uh-huh, no war! no guns! no corps!
just life, just love, no hype, just fun
no ties, just me and my mind
just me and my wife, but tell me if i'm dreamin'
'cause i don't wanna wake up till the evenin'
and i don't wanna be left sleepin'
from all the diseases that i breathe in
look, respect the island, no stealin'
and don't bring religion here, no three kings
integrated, and we ain't leavin'!
we come on a peace t'ing
white flag? white flag!

junk boats and english boys
crashing out in super marts
electric fences and guns
you swallow me
i'm a pill on your tongue
here on the nineteenth floor
the neon lights make me calm
and late in a star's life
it begins to explode
and all the people in a dream
wait for the machine
to pick the shit up, leave it clean
kid, hang over here
what you learning in school?
is the rise of an eastern sun
gonna be good for everyone?
the radio station disappears
music turning to thin air
the dj was the last to leave
she had well conditioned hair
was beautiful, but nothing really was there
"hello? hello?

yeah, wah gwaan, brudda?
time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
change them sheets, you got stains undercover
better look sharp, now your face on the cover
like a chameleon, see a change in your color
crabs in the barrel, wanna hate on each other
so my life gets better, whatever the weather
i dance in the rain and i bathe in summer
it's the black corleone in the button-up shirt
before we take off you better buckle up first
fresher than the president, psychedelics got me in my element
all negativity, that's irrelevant
amber leaf or ganja leaf, i back strap when i wrap the sheets
now i feel to go for a drive, so i grab my keys
shades on, roof down, tryna catch a breeze
ridin' 'round the hood, got the devil in my ear
can you smell that? smells like jealousy in the air
don't know who they're tryna scare
looked at the man in the mirror, that's the only enemy that i fear
a zombie knows who to frighten
just know i love the action, but i move in silence
and, right now, i'm just takin' what's mine 'till elizabeth returns to diamonds
wah gwaan, brudda?
time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
change them sheets, you got stains undercover
better look sharp, now your face on the cover
tryna be the boss of life, gets tougher
i hope you're ready for the truth that you're gonna discover
always gonna be a judas at the last supper
stay woke, it's a rocky road on the come-up
i take the shots like scorsese
more money, more problems and more ladies
everyday somebody die, still, mothers give birth to more babies
the earth spins, the world gets more crazy
you gotta have a suit for the christening
a suit for the wedding and a suit for the court case
probably wear the same suit to the funeral
tryna see the bigger picture, man, it's bigger than the portrait
bigger than me, no, you can't fight of your demons with vitamin c
have to open your mind, use your vision and see
keep your eyes on the prize so vigilantly
love how you live, remember the world, full of expensive shit
can't forget the poor 'cause you're friends with the rich
stay true to the mold, i ain't ever gonna switch
yeah, yeah-yeah, wah gwaan, brudda?
time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
change them sheets, you got stains undercover
better look sharp, now your face on the cover
hm, who's that pressin' on the buzzer?
better check the camera, you don't wanna get stuck up
you listen close, you can hear death around the corner
one wrong move and we're all gonna suffer
ahh, ehn, oya
e dide, ero re, oya
e dide, ero re, oya
e dide, ero re, oya
e dide, ero re, e dide
how far, brudda?
time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
change them sheets, you got stains undercover
better look sharp, now your face on the cover

you are now entering the harmonic realm
when you're smoking tin foil in the morning
it's gonna be a cold day
when you're keeping everything inside you
it can only hurt you
unrelated sounds
the sun will shine again
you hold it in your hands
this land is a young land let it stay that way
its pollution only turns you into
something you don't want to see in the water
a reflection of them that you receive
you don't own the sun
and the sun won't shine again
so maybe you're all in love
with aluminium
the cling and a clang
is the metal in my head when i walk
i hear a sort of, this tinging noise
cling clang
the cling clang
so many things happen while walking
the metal in my head clangs and clings as i walk
freaks my balance out
so the natural thought
is just clogged up
totally clogged up
so we need to unplug these dams
and make the natural flow
it sort of freaks me out
we need to unplug the dams
you cannot stop the natural flow of thought
with a cling and a clang
and wake me up again until
we're aluminium
you hold it in your hands
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
finally, someone let me out of my cage
now, time for me is nothing, 'cause i'm countin' no age
nah, i couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
i'm good at repairs, and i'm under each snare
intangible, bet you didn't think, so i command you to
panoramic view, look, i'll make it all manageable
pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
picture you getting down in a picture tube
like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
mystical? maybe, spiritual hero
who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
priceless to you, because i put you on the hype shit
you like it? gun smokin', righteous with one toke
get psychic among those, possess you with one dose
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on (that's right)
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
the essence, the basics, without it, you make it
allow me to make this childlike in nature
rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
i'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
i see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (that's right)
from this fuckin' enterprise, now i'm sucked into your lies
through russel, not his muscles
but percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
that's the inner (fuck 'em) so i'ma stick around with russ and be a mentor
bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
where the thought is, i brought all this
so you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
no squealing and remember that it's all in your head
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future
is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on
my future

up on melancholy hill, there's a plastic tree
are you here with me?
just looking out on the day of another dream
where you can't get what you want, but you can get me
so let's set out to sea, love
'cause you are my medicine when you're close to me
when you're close to me
so call in the submarines, 'round the world we'll go
does anybody know her
if we're looking out on the day of another dream?
if you can't get what you want, then come with me

take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
take it in your heart
take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
where it all goes down
outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
i took it to the right man
took it all back
when the courts were closing
it was bobby gracing
i know that
i put it to the right man
he put it back
talk to the crowds
stacks of lights
come streaming back
make it for the best times
growing pains, good times
good times, good times
good times, good times

calling the world from isolation
'cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
and if you're coming back to find me
you'd better have good aim
shoot it true, i need you in the picture
that's why i'm calling you
(calling you) i'm the lonely twin, the left hand
reset myself and get back on track
i don't want this isolation
see the state i'm in now?
calling the hunter with the rifle
'cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained

(calling you) i'm the lonely twin, the left hand
reset myself and get back on track

do i put it back?
or do i head out onto the lonesome trail
and let you down?
i'm the lonely twin, the left hand

or do i head out onto the lonesome trail
and let you go?
slow it down some, no split, clown bum
your gold hits sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
where you found them at?
got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it
would have floated, bloated, voted
sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
that blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
crank it on blast, roll past front street
blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
these kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?
something has started today
where did it go? what you want it to be?
well you know, november has come
when it's gone away
(oh, what they say)
something has started today
where did it go? what you want it to be?
well you know, november has come
when it's gone away
bah, can you dig it like a spigot?
my guess is yes you can, like can i kick it, wicked,
liquor shot if you happy and you know it
as you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
grope a pen and i'm in cope hymen
doper rhymin' more worther than the hope diamond
acquired off the black market
a wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
the rapid-fire spark lit (zzzt!) a rapper bug zapper
and it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
the beats got family members askin' him for closure
aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em clean it
then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
she wore a filled-in thong of billabong
that said "nah fo'real-a, the villain on a gorilla jawn?"

i need a gun to keep myself among
the poor people are burning in the sun
but they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
i need a gun 'cause all i do is dance
'cause all i do is dance
i need a gun to keep myself among
the poor people are burning in the sun
but they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
i need a gun 'cause all i do is dance
'cause all i do is dance
in my backpack, i got my act right in case you act quite difficult
and your result weaken
with anger and discontent some are seeking
and in search of like nimoy
i'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
i change your whole location to a pine box, six under
impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
orders given to me is strike and i'm thunder
with lightning-fast reflexes
on constant alert from the constant hurt
that seems limitless with no drop in pressure
it seems like everybody's out to test ya, 'till they see you break
you can't conceal the hate that consumes you
i'm the reason why you fill up your isuzu
chill with your old lady at the tilt
i got a ninety-day extension and i'm filled with guilt
from things that i seen
your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
at night i hear the shots ring, so i'm a light sleeper
the cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
out in the desert with my street sweeper
"the war is over", so said the speaker
with the flight suit on
maybe to him, i'm just a pawn
so he can advance
remember when i used to dance?
man, all i wanna do is dance
i need a gun to keep myself among
mama mavis, oh, mama, they tried my patience
{obama} is gone, who is left to save us?
{orlando,} we mourn, i'm praying for my neighbors
they say the devil's at work and {trump} is calling favors
you say i'm dangerous, i speak for the nameless
i fly with the vultures, i be with them bangers
if change don't come, then the change won't come
if the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
(woo!)
am i passin' into the light?
(am i looking into mercy's eyes?)
look into your eyes
all the world is out of your hands
(then ascending into the dark, let me out)
you got to die a little if you wanna live
change come to pass
change come to pass
you'd best be ready for it
something i've begun to fear is about to change its form
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
but i won't get tired at all
let me out
let me out
let me out
let me out
look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
tell me that i won't die at the hands of the police
promise me i won't outlive my nephew and my niece
promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that i teach
tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
but until then, i keep my piece in arm's reach
am i passin' into the light?
(am i looking into mercy's eyes?)
all the world is out of your hands
(then ascending into the dark) another night
you got to die a little if you wanna live
change coming
you'd best be ready for it
something i've begun to fear is about to change its form
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
but i won't get tired at all

summer don't know me no more
he got mad, that's all
summer don't know me
he'd just let me low in myself
'cause i do know love
from you then, just dying
i saw that day
lost my mind
lord, i'm fine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
don't stop the bud, when it comes
it's the dawn, you'll see
money won't get there
ten years passed tonight, you'll flee
if you do that
i'll be sworn
to find you
i saw that day
lost my mind
lord, i'm fine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
i saw that day
lost my mind
lord, i'm fine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
(i saw that day)
(lost my mind)
(lord, i’m fine)
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
maybe in time, you'll want to be mine
i'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
with a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
i'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
the shadow in the corner, just playing along
i'm only laying in my bed, i'm rolling aside
but if i get a car, i'm hoping to ride
because i know if i ever say "i'm leaving" to you
you've gotta volunteer, and you don't know what to do
you're soft
you wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (alright, how are we doin'?)
and if you're thinking that i don't know what you're thinking, baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you do more thinking and i'll go out and make it alright (alright, how do you do?)
i’m impregnable, incredible, the setting of quo
i’m at lay chimirida, not a heart and soul
i got a saturday night, and nothing is dead
and if i ever had to do it, well, you know i wouldn’t care
i just kicked down, i love when i’m seen
yeah, and if i wanna talk back, the message is free
then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
and if you get popped here, you get ‘em a lot
you get a heart, break
you wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (alright, how are we doin'?)
and if you're thinking that i don't know what you're thinking, baby (a-a-a-a-aha)
you do more thinking and i'll go out and make it alright (alright, how do you do?)
every time we try, we get nowhere
wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? yeah
trying so hard to act like we don't care
but it's true, you do, nothing is left
so i guess i'm right
new word, onomatopoeia (boom)
quit actin' like you don't wanna be here
fuck around and get jumped like leap year
glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
get the fuck on, gone
okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
my girl look pretty up there riding dick
my plaid past, my solid future
asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
i'm an outkast but you're into me
summer got mad cause the winter blew me

trying so hard to act like we don't care (i don't care)
but it's true, you do, nothing is left
so i guess i'm right
flip the page, our days are revelatious
space is strange, doctor, i've got no patience
oh, it's all a part of the process (okay, okay)
nothing's new, it's true, cool, i admit
shit, i guess you're right
the world is spinning too fast
i'm buying lead nike shoes
to keep myself tethered
to the days i've tried to lose
my mama said to slow down

stop dancing to the music
of gorillaz in a happy mood

momentary bliss
we could do so much better than this
mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
we could do so much better than this
oh, rita, oh, rita
lovely rita, meter maid
lovely rita, meter maid
you're potential, you lack credentials
and you are special, so fucking special (rita)
oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
and you keep squeezing the truth from the middle (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
you parted seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (ah)
and you was gaggin' for some gags and now you're rollin' (woo)
best you shut your trap and keep it hush (hush)
on another note, compliments make me blush
there's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
cavern of your mind, you say your pattern
you pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say: (ah, ah, ah)
"what was scripted, the day before it happened?"
we all give applause when people open doors
but on the way out and get your back in
see, everything in life ain't silver and gold
but minin' for metal gave you platinum
it makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
it's wearing thin to think light bulb don't blink
just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
you're a turkey twizzler, you deserve school dinners
makes me sick
poster boy (ayy)
poster girl (rita)
truth, the bills (the bills)
must be paid (yeah, yeah, alright)
poster boy (yeah, alright)
poster girl (ah, that's time)
in truth, the bills, they must be paid (uh-huh)
and what is left is sodding atypical
all you need to change your face
you're gettin' sold, you're such a waste
you know, we could do so much better than this
swimmin' in pools of momentary bliss
where you gotta find a family 'cause everybody taken
they worry you keep on adding
i think you gotta crawl
it makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
it's wearing thin, to think light bulb don't blink
just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
you're a turkey twizzler, you deserve school dinners
it makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
it's wearing thin, to think light bulbs don't blink
just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
you're a turkey twizzler, you deserve school dinners
makes me sick
we could do so much better than this
mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
we could do so much better than this
oh, rita, oh, rita
we could do so much better than this
perfect little pictures of moments that we missed
we could do so much better than this
oh, rita, oh, rita
i'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
that you made with plastic power
your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
drive on engines till they weep
with future pixels in factories far away
so call the mainland from the beach
your heart is now washed up in bleach
the waves are rising for this time of year
and nobody knows what to do with the heat
under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
while rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky
(uh)
(mmmmm)
i can't see you now my heart is frozen
all the bowses and the growses
have been abstinated in my soul
i prayed on the immovable
yet clinging to the atoms of rock
seasons see adjustment signs of change
i can't see now, she said, "taxi"
now that light is all i can take
this dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
i'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
that you made with plastic power
your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
(here we go again)
that's electric
(uh)
that's electric
helicopters fly over the beach
same time every day, same routine
a clear target in the summer when skies are blue
it's part of the noise when winter comes
it reverberates in my lungs
nature's corrupted in factories far away
(here we go again)
that's electric
your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
that's electric
with future pixels in factories far away
(here we go again)
that's electric
your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
that's electric
with future pixels in factories far away
(here we go again)
okay, last time
this is drugs
this is your brain on drugs
any questions?

peek out and summon the code
and i enter the lake to face what i'm cagin'

oscillate yourself tonight
when you're in your bed
simulate the dopamine
passing through your head
when you get back on a saturday night
and the room is caving in
do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?
see yourself in cupid's lake
chipped in your head
do you indicate to satellites
passing by the edge?
when you get back on a saturday night
and your head is caving in
do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?
do you dance like this forever?
do you look like me?
do you burn like me?

oh, joys are us, the sun has come again to hold you
sailing out the doldrums of the week
the polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you
it's all around you, out here
and if the whole world is crashing down (on you)
fall through space out of mind with me
where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
blows all the shadows far away
the falling of the whole empire, is here to hold you
rolling out and haunted till it sleeps
little memories, marching on
your little feet, working the machine
say will it spin, will it soar?
my little dream, working the machine
soon, like a wave, empires will fall
and closing in on you, they're going on
little memories
your little feet, working the machine
say will it spin, will it soar?
my little dream, working the machine
soon like a wave, empires will fall
closing in on you, they're going on
where does it come from?
when everything was outside
busted and blue
how in the universe?
through the lithium
busted and blue
i was asked by a computer
a shadow on the wall
an image made by virgil
to rule over us all
so amplify the sirens
and to find real amends
i'm through the echo-chambers
to other worlds i went
all my life
all my life
beam a light on me
i am a satellite
and i can't get back without you
be my love
be my love
be my light
be my light
where do they come from?
the wires that connect to us
weightless and fall on your body
'til we're invisible
i'm with you through altitudes
busted and blue
all my life
all my life
beam a light on me
i am a satellite
and i can't get back without you
be my love
be my love
be my light
be my light
busted and blue

i sense the need in her grammar
her nose has never been skatin' (uh-huh)
but she's sippin' star constellation (shit)
for real, her squirt game was so like 2pac out of court run towards camera (uh-huh)
my response to that was just, "check please"
fuck that, my man, you can't let these (moments)
pass you by like "tick tock"
so i'm smackin' the bottom like flip flops
made her alarm ring (she screams)
and now we done, we passed the test
so now lay down to rest
and wait for the mornin' hangover that comes

here is our tree
that primitively grows
and when you go to bed
scarecrows from the far east
come to eat
its tender fruits
and i thought the best way to perfect our tree
is by building walls
walls like unicorns
in full glory and galore
and even stronger
than the walls of jericho
but glad then my friend
out in the field, we shall reap a better day
what we have always dreamt of having
are now for the starving
it is love, that is the root of all evil
but not our tree
and thank you, my friend
for trusting me
hallelujah

how will we know?
when the morning comes
we are still human
how will we know?
how will we dream?
how will we love?
how will we know?
don't worry, my friend
if this be the end, then so shall it be
until we say so, nothing will move
ah, don't worry
it's not against our morals
it's legally tender
touch, my friend
while the whole world
and whole beasts of nations desire
power
when the morning comes
we are still human
how will we know?
how will we dream?
how will we love?
how will we know?

my face will be painted in these white brick lines
'cause all my fears invaded
all the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
living on the limits
and if you say goodbye too many times
the sentinels will find me and switch me off this time
'cause all my fear's evaded
all the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you

baby, i just survive
i'm love drunk, i'm sorry
am i losing you?

trying to find tomorrow ain't easy 'til you dive in
swimming pools
why you rolling waves over me now, that's all i need, dreaming
waiting on la to come find me, be forgiven
i'll be a regular guy for you, i never said i'd do that
why you looking so beautiful to me now when you so sad?

pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
we're here tonight for a very special offering
an offering of our spirits this evening in unison
but first, a word of instruction
hello, hello
please leave all your belongings at the door
you can sit or stand, we can take a vote
and just tiptoe to the centre of the circle
while we unveil the ropes
still a little room left to hang your clothes
some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
ready, set, go
i lock hands with yours
we dive into the floor (drop)
when we reach the core
then we stomp some more (drop)
i lock hands with yours
and then we dive down into the floor
seven thousand miles 'til we reach the core
and then we circle back and we stomp some more, got it?
it's just like that
you promise all your life, then you turn your back
you glide across the space, and diagonal past
then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
you move your hips and your arms like a cat
spin three times, and you're back where you're at
does anybody catch what any of this is about?
no? well, work it out
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
okay, slide like a lizard, walk like a crab
eyes dilated, dark to the grass
then when you find you're invisible, you melt into a puzzle
keep it flowing like the rivers do
you gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
and if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
don't take the chance, not worth the risk
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
out of body from morning to night
dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright
who knows?
there's always stains on what's real and true
tonight is a special, special occasion
and all that's left for us to do, is move

i feel better when i don't need that
everybody gonna funk the night

everybody says that i'm more
feelin' out of body, i'm drinkin' it up
can i tell you what the dream's about tonight?
(dance floor packed and i'm feeling alright)

aries
i'm looking out at a volcano
trying to read the world today and see where you're at
i'll never do that
i'm a model that is uncomplicated
you can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'cause then i am silenced
i'm standing on a beach in the distance
and even though you're far away, can you see my red light?
it's waiting to turn green
'cause i feel so isolated without you
i can't play a happy tune on my own, so stay by my side
high or low tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
and it feels like i'm falling in, again
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
feels like i'm falling in, again
i'm a model that is uncomplicated
you can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'cause then i am silenced
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
and it feels like i'm falling in, again
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
high tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
feels like i'm falling in, again
don't try to hide away
you know you've been on
though i'm keeping calm, i'm not on
go away, my love
thought i could change our fate
i tried again, but this delay
it's more than i can take
and it got to me
when you state your love
and you walk away
what could you be on?
now you're not around
but i hope you see
i will be full-on
if it's up to me
it's all i got
feels so good doing me
if you take a look at the time you took and move on
but don't go too far, my lover
we could try harder, baby
there's gotta be a better way
so much that we could make it
and it got to me
when you state your love
but you run away
what could you be on?
now you're not around
but i hope you see
gotta be full-on
it is up to me
it's all i got
it's all i got
it's all i got
it's all i got
wish i could think of better ways
'cause i lost my patience yesterday
if you could see inside of me
there'd be no heart on my x-ray
opponents tryna checkmate
but i don't see no escape
just tryna keep my head straight
on thin ice with the ice skates
at times, i feel like givin' up
'cause it feels like i've had enough
felt like my soul in handcuffs
got questions with no answers
can't help me out, i need a friend
i'm losin' faith in this world of sin
tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
it's like a cycle that never ends
i can't contend with no handlin'
i can't take care of no grown man
all by myself, cryin' for help
but won't get saved by no superman
all comes down to the mighty dollar
greed and lust, abusin' power
clock is tickin', hour after hour
makes me wanna throw my hands and holler
and you got to me
when you state your love
but you run away
what could you be on?
now you're not around
but i hope you see
gotta be full-on
it is up to me
everybody's here with me
we've got no camera to see
don't think i'm all in this world
the camera won't let me roll
the verdict doesn't love our soul
the digital won't let me go
yeah, yeah, yeah, i'll pay
when tomorrow
tomorrow comes today
stereo, i want it on
it's taken me far too long
don't think i'm all in this world
don't think i'll be here too long
don't think i'll be here too long, no
(don't think i'll be here too long)
i don't think i'll be here too long
(i don't think i'll be here too long)

once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
there was a town where the people known as happyfolk lived
their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
obscured as it was by great clouds
here they played out their peaceful lives
innocent of the litany of excess and violence
that was growing in the world below
to live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called monkey was enough
then one day, strangefolk arrived in the town
they came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses
but no one noticed them, they only saw shadows
you see, without the truth of the eyes, the happyfolk were blind
falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head
now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
the dance of the dead, the dance of the dead
in time, strangefolk found their way into the high reaches of the mountain
and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable, sincerity and beauty
by chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
the strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
and soon they began to mine the mountain
its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world
meanwhile, down in the town, the happyfolk slept restlessly
their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
and as the strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear
bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the monkey
for the first time
the happyfolk felt fearful
for they knew that soon the monkey would stir from its deep sleep
and then came a sound, distant first
it grew into castrophany
so immense it could be heard far away in space
there were no screams, there was no time
the mountain called monkey had spoken, there was only fire
and then...nothing
o little town in u.s.a., your time has come to see
there's nothing you believe you want
but where were you when it all came down on me?
did you call me? no...
to the dark, dark seas
comes the only whale
watching ships go by
it's the day we try
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio on a plastic beach
it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
it's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio
did they haul you out
on a really hot day?
when the call got made
you had gone away
from us
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio on a plastic beach
it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
it's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio
casio, casio, casio and green, green glow
casio, casio, casio, green, green glow
casio, casio, casio and green, green glow
casio, casio, casio
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio on a plastic beach
it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
it's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
it's a casio on a plastic beach, it's a casio
plastico, plastico, plastico where the green, green grows
plastico, plastico, plastico
plastico, plastico, plastico where the green, green grows
plastico, plastico, plastico
waiting by the mailbox, by the train
passin' by the hills 'til i hear the name
i'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all i want is
someone to rely on as thunder comes a-rolling down
someone to rely on as the lightning comes a-staring in again
i'll wait to be forgiven, maybe i never will
my star has left me to take the bitter pill
that shattered feeling, well, the cause of it's a lesson learned
"just don't know if i could roll into the sea again
just don't know if i could do it all again," she said—it's true
waiting in my room, and i lock the door
i watch the coloured animals across the floor
and i'm looking from a distance and i'm listening to the whispers
and oh, it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling
and you're falling in and caught again
cau-au-au-aught again
i'm caught again in the mystery
you're by my side, but are you still with me?
the answer's somewhere deep in it, i'm sorry but you're feeling it
but i just have to tell you that i love you so much these days
have to tell you that i love you so much these days, it's true
my heart is in economy
due to this autonomy
rolling in and caught again
cau-au-au-aught again
cau-au-au-aught again
(cau-au-au-aught again)
my heart is in economy
due to this autonomy (cau-au-au-aught again)
rolling in and caught again
cau-au-au-aught again
distant stars
come in black or red
i've seen their worlds
inside my head
they connect
with the fall of man
they breathe you in
then dive as deep as they can
there's nothing you can do for them
they are the force between
when the sunlight is arising
there's nothing you can say to him
he is in outer heart
and the space has been broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
is it far away
in the glitter freeze
or in our eyes
every time they meet
it's by the light
of the plasma screens
we keep switched on
all through the night while we sleep
there's nothing you can do for them
they are the force between
when the sunlight is arising
there's nothing you can say to her
i am without a heart
and the space has been broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
it's broken
our love
it's broken
where the beautiful people at?
i said where the beautiful people at?
beautiful people, clap your hands (yeah)
freaky people, clap your hands
geeky people, clap your hands

distant-far like yonderin'
skin of my tooth like, skin of my boot like
fly in my soup like, "where's the waitress?"
can i take this, really, can i finish this?
these airs and all these graces
it's my mistake, i'll make it
j-dub to the boom now make it
bounce, wiggle, bounce, wiggle
shakin' all them bangs out
chemical cutthroats, bound to blow the brain out
cut to the brain, this ain't no game
i'll show no shame, i'll birth this blame
i'm twisted cain, i'll twist a-gain
i'll push the blade, as plain as day
known to what these sayers say
known to what these doers do
it's you and who and you-know-where
we's about to take it there
we's about to make it clear, we happy or we lonesome
the long jump, the beat heart, from start to finish
ten spoons of spinach, the soul and the spillage
the cup that runneth over, return of the ogre!

some kind of nature
some kind of soul
some kind of mixture
some kind of gold
some kind of majesty
some chemical load
some kind of metal
made up from glue
some kind of plastic
i could wrap around you
the needy eat man-mades
they wear phony clothes
they sit with barbiturates
until they grow old
some kind of nature
some kind of soul
some kind of mixture
some kind of gold
some kind of majesty
some chemical load
well, me, i like plastics
and digital foils
to wrap up the sound
and protect the girls
from the spiritual poison
you spill at night
like phony clothes but
i really like mine
some kind of nature
some kind of nature
some kind of soul
come forth within us
oh lord, forgive me
some kind of mixture
some kind of gold
it's gonna come and find us
all we are is dust
some kind of metal, some kind of metal
made up from glue, made up from glue
some kind of plastic, some kind of plastic
i could wrap around you
the needy eat man-mades
they wear phony clothes
they sit with barbiturates
until they grow old
some kind of nature
some kind of nature
some kind of soul
come forth within us
oh lord, forgive me
some kind of mixture

are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls?
take a gun, or how you say
that's no way
to behave
you’re just alone when you begin
to sing a song that doesn’t sin
it grows (hey) you know
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls?
are we the last to get away?
to a sun another day?
or do we know
well, we know
it doesn't seem to be conveyed that way
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls?
get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up...
lord, save me
'cause all i've sung
i got it down and wrong
i've seen myself today
 the lord, seeing all now
can we take a sound?
i bought the car and all
the coldest man doesn't say it's wrong
we go to the car
i see you walk into the fog
and when you get there do you see?
you see the last, it's you and me
'cause we're the last living souls
we're the last living souls
yeah, we're the last living souls
we're the last living souls
is it resolution?
or black and white flying balloons?
floating off, too colourful
or is it separation
you put it to your counting sand
waiting for the world to start again?
ticker tape
ticker tape
tick-tick-ticker tape
is this how you're feeling?
falling with the world tonight
cauterized and beautiful
slide the light
is this how you're healing?
out there in the paradigm
waiting for a cavalcade to come again
ticker tape
ticker tape
tick-tick-ticker tape
ticker tape
black light glints with colour
sudden long and horizontal outlines the star
a sudden draft and quick chill
a single snowflake falls
and that is all
that is all
the world's face hidden under folding wing
waiting for the world to start again
waiting for the world to start again
waiting for the world to start again
waiting for the world... again
'cause we're working through it
working through your nightmare
watch the worker bees
as they're working for it
working through the night shift
and i'm working through it
working through the nightmare
watch the worker bees
as they're working for it
working through the night shift
are you leaving for the rest of it?
coming back to ghosts inside
or is it just too late for that?
and i'm hoping for a little juice
déjalo
si quieres continuar, hermano
sal, ilumina tu vida
todo el cielo aplastándote
dime qué harás
enfréntalo
ilumina ese amor
antes que se vaya
algo siempre te entristece
cuando todo va bien
¿qué pasa contigo?
¿qué pasa contigo?
déjalo
si quieres continuar
no ocultes tu alma al sol
tienes una vida preciosa
de qué sirve si solo
muerte sobre media ciudad
¿qué pasa?
¿qué pasa contigo?
¿qué pasa contigo, mi hermano?
¿qué pasa contigo?
escucha a tu propia voz
salva tu amor
¿qué pasa contigo?
antes que se vaya
si todo va bien
¿qué pasa contigo?
¿qué pasa contigo?
mírate a ti mismo
enfréntalo
¿qué pasa contigo?
mi hermano
ven animate
¿qué pasa contigo?
oh, palace flows
rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
when the light shines through it i feel more exposed
will it ever change here? we'll just never know
stimulation, i'm in need of
see the time is of the essence and this clock doesn't own a home
rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
when the light shines through i feel more exposed
in tune, with myself on it, my mind is my weakness
with your strength, you might surprise yourself
never deny yourself, i live in the space is my thesis
i know you need this, i know you need this
i'm prone to run out of pieces
that might connect to something bigger
all in your mind, could follow me, you should consider
look at the time, i'm probably later than ever
"what did you find?" well come in here, and lit it with pressure
i look to the heavens and i saw open gates
i walked up and then i paused
what the fuck did you do this for?
wish me luck when that midnight falls
memories of a past life
can this be? this is our time, can this be? this is our time
come on
in stillness, known to the world, do you feel this?
trapped in my mind, hope i can find solitude
when connecting all of these pieces
i know you need this, i know you need this
i fold and unleash the beast
unknown is what i would be
if my whole purpose here wasn't to speak
now look at the time, i know that i am early today
what did you find when giving up and running away?
i gazed to the stars and this view can't be shared
when there are no other eyes in this room
mean the words when you sing your tune
free as a bird when i intake fumes
memories of this past life
can this be? this is our time, can this be? this is our time
come on
give up if you wanna survive
get oh so alive in your life
everything falling out the sky on top of you
now what you do?
set yourself up now
it's the love of your life
shallowly on me
all i know, before it's gone
i always feel it's getting you down
if nothing's wrong
what's the matter with me?
what's the matter with me?
give up if you wanna survive
pick the sound back up
you got to get on the song, lonely
what's the point?
it's funny 'til you're left to kill yourself
in this town
so what's the matter with me?
what's the matter with me?
what's the matter with me?
what's the matter with me?
i'm on the high ridge looking down
while we're evolving in it all
if i get back then i'll be grateful
look there's a billboard on the moon
let me take you this far
this crossing isn't much to me
there's lightning in the storm clouds
and i'll send you there to stay
you got me lost in magic city
you got me questioning it all
i hope that i make it home by wednesday
and this magic city lets me go
magic city
magic city
magic city
magic city
you put me up here in the penthouse
and painted me in red, white and blue
i filled the canyons with my ego
look there's a billboard on the moon
you got me lost in magic city
you got me questioning it all
i hope that i make it home by wednesday
and this magic city lets me go
hey
what is this drumming i'm hearing now?
all over me

all over me

okay
in the morning it came to me
build a tunnel from zurich to new york
i find it hard to share this with anyone
because even to me it sounded ridiculous
but one morning
after a long complicated night
i made my mind up, to share my vision with the world
everything that follows
i'm not responsible for
i landed on the silver lake
washed up and feeling blue
heard the sound of footsteps
drifting softly to the moon
looking for clear water
i had to take control
out there in the wilderness
another bullet hole
playing it all for gods
yesterday
idaho, idaho
there's a beauty on the road
every day, i look out on the bus
silver lining's getting lost
floated out into the woods
to hear the old elk call
touched a rainbow with my hands
i'm dry, i got 'em all
"ride on," said the king of cool
you've got nothing to lose
tinseltown is down the road
it's the bullet or the noose
if you're playing it all for gods
far away
idaho, idaho
there's a beauty on the road
and every day, i look out of the bus
silver lining's getting lost
carnival
we play to win, just to find the dark
go home again, and we both fall out
i wanna spend this time with you
doing nothing
keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
i hear the music in the background
singing, singing
oh, i haven't see the glory
coming, coming, coming
and we play
we play, we play, we play like a
just like a carnival
game, just like a carnival
laugh, just like a carnival
joke, just like a
spinning me round and around and around
just like a carnival
we play to win, just to find the dark
go again, and we both fall out
i wanna spend this time with you
doing nothing
we, just like a carnival
we laughed, just like a carnival
sleep with the dead, just like a carnival
playing with your mind, just like a
spinning me round and around and around
just like a carnival, yeah

slow it up, underground where (just like that) the under us undercut
shipped up, shipped out, swimmin' with the sharks put my gills up
(just like that) turn the wheels up real tough
(just like that) drinkin' lemonade in the shade
getting blazed with a gang of pilgrims
(just like that) yeah, this my path
belly floppin' lockin' while i'm rockin' in the bubble bath
(just like that) and i'm just like math
fozo's added up that get you more cash

(just like that) welcome to the world of the plastic beach
(just like that) welcome to the world of the plastic beach, yeah
(just like that) welcome to the world of the plastic beach
welcome to the world of the plastic beach
ayy, look, yo, no castaway, no survivor
i ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
i feel small in this big wide world
and mummy ain't said "honey, i shrunk the kids" yet
i ain't jesus, but i'm walking on water
there's no bombs here, there's no war, 'cause
i can break out of jail with a lighter
so is there any point in making laws, blud?
this ain't atlantis, are you sure?
i nearly suffocated when i touched the shore
no rain, condoms it poured
and up the road, you'd never guess who i saw
uh, uh, uh, it's k-a
look, skip on the beat like ali in the gym (yeah)
honey, i'm home this is where i wanna live (yeah)
just found it like nemo on the d-low
i don't know if it's greener, but it's green though
on the other side of the fence, bye to the ends
look, no feds, no stress, no rent
no superficial shit, this real flow
where the women look hot, but the beach cold
and the speech goes like, "hi, little lady
sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby?"
word in the village, i'm a little bit crazy
swagger on a hundred degrees, no eighty
look, if heaven had a vip
uh, this is it: white sand, blue sea
but i don't know who they are
and i'm damn sure they don't know me, but i come in peace
cool! white flag! white flag!
uh-huh, no war! no guns! no corps!
just life, just love, no hype, just fun
no ties, just me and my mind
just me and my wife, but tell me if i'm dreamin'
'cause i don't wanna wake up till the evenin'
and i don't wanna be left sleepin'
from all the diseases that i breathe in
look, respect the island, no stealin'
and don't bring religion here, no three kings
integrated, and we ain't leavin'!
we come on a peace t'ing
white flag? white flag!

revolving doors, what will i become?
a redneck song
paid up for seven
but he only got an eight now, now
i feel that i'm paused by all the pills
i see no wrong in here
on a foggy day
(revolving doors in london to a foggy day in boston)
(revolving doors in london to a foggy day in boston)
i sit in a diner and the beatles play
(revolving doors in london to a foggy day in boston)
i'm paid up for a seven
but i only got s.o. eight, oh, now

i feel that i'm paused by all the pills
i seem to run out here
(revolving doors in london to a foggy day in boston)

it's stormy on the eastern seaboard
he got silver up his nose

junk boats and english boys
crashing out in super marts
electric fences and guns
you swallow me
i'm a pill on your tongue
here on the nineteenth floor
the neon lights make me calm
and late in a star's life
it begins to explode
and all the people in a dream
wait for the machine
to pick the shit up, leave it clean
kid, hang over here
what you learning in school?
is the rise of an eastern sun
gonna be good for everyone?
the radio station disappears
music turning to thin air
the dj was the last to leave
she had well conditioned hair
was beautiful, but nothing really was there
"hello? hello?

yeah, wah gwaan, brudda?
time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
change them sheets, you got stains undercover
better look sharp, now your face on the cover
like a chameleon, see a change in your color
crabs in the barrel, wanna hate on each other
so my life gets better, whatever the weather
i dance in the rain and i bathe in summer
it's the black corleone in the button-up shirt
before we take off you better buckle up first
fresher than the president, psychedelics got me in my element
all negativity, that's irrelevant
amber leaf or ganja leaf, i back strap when i wrap the sheets
now i feel to go for a drive, so i grab my keys
shades on, roof down, tryna catch a breeze
ridin' 'round the hood, got the devil in my ear
can you smell that? smells like jealousy in the air
don't know who they're tryna scare
looked at the man in the mirror, that's the only enemy that i fear
a zombie knows who to frighten
just know i love the action, but i move in silence
and, right now, i'm just takin' what's mine 'till elizabeth returns to diamonds
wah gwaan, brudda?
time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
change them sheets, you got stains undercover
better look sharp, now your face on the cover
tryna be the boss of life, gets tougher
i hope you're ready for the truth that you're gonna discover
always gonna be a judas at the last supper
stay woke, it's a rocky road on the come-up
i take the shots like scorsese
more money, more problems and more ladies
everyday somebody die, still, mothers give birth to more babies
the earth spins, the world gets more crazy
you gotta have a suit for the christening
a suit for the wedding and a suit for the court case
probably wear the same suit to the funeral
tryna see the bigger picture, man, it's bigger than the portrait
bigger than me, no, you can't fight of your demons with vitamin c
have to open your mind, use your vision and see
keep your eyes on the prize so vigilantly
love how you live, remember the world, full of expensive shit
can't forget the poor 'cause you're friends with the rich
stay true to the mold, i ain't ever gonna switch
yeah, yeah-yeah, wah gwaan, brudda?
time to hustle for the money, give the change to your mother
change them sheets, you got stains undercover

my world seems open
every satellite up here is watching
but i was here from the very start
trying to find a way to your heart
all the days of forgetting
they've gone out with the tide
lost at sea somewhere, waiting
like setting suns at the rodeo
trying to find someone you'll never know
oh, sinking love
on the cloud of unknowing
every satellite up here is watching
waiting to see what the morning brings
may bring sunshine on its wings

you are now entering the harmonic realm
when you're smoking tin foil in the morning
it's gonna be a cold day
when you're keeping everything inside you
it can only hurt you
unrelated sounds
the sun will shine again
you hold it in your hands
this land is a young land let it stay that way
its pollution only turns you into
something you don't want to see in the water
a reflection of them that you receive
you don't own the sun
and the sun won't shine again
so maybe you're all in love
with aluminium
the cling and a clang
is the metal in my head when i walk
i hear a sort of, this tinging noise
cling clang
the cling clang
so many things happen while walking
the metal in my head clangs and clings as i walk
freaks my balance out
so the natural thought
is just clogged up
totally clogged up
so we need to unplug these dams
and make the natural flow
it sort of freaks me out
we need to unplug the dams
you cannot stop the natural flow of thought
with a cling and a clang
and wake me up again until
we're aluminium
you hold it in your hands
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again
the sun will shine again

i got lost on the highway
but don't ask me where i've been
or what i've done
oh, lord, send me transmissions
forgive me for what i've become
the son has come to save me
put a little love into my lonely soul
