ghouls attack the church
crush the holy priest
turning the cross towards hell
writhe in satan's flames
crush the priest
the feeble church
dead your god is dead
fools your god is dead
useless prayers of lies
behold satan's rise
crush the priest
the feeble church
the family of dog
lust upon the altar
demons attack with hate
satan in the fires of hell awaits
death against you all
god hear my death call
crush the priest
the feeble church
the family of dog
lust upon my altar
lies
and you fill their souls
with all oppressions of this world
and all the glory you receive
so, what makes you supreme?
rise, and your crown is falling
i offer fantasy
and you, creator, are blind with envy
let the children come to me
their mother loves me, so shall they
woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
man was close behind
just like a snake i'm slithering
through my world divine
and like the cat i'm stalking
i'll take your soul and you'll be like me
in emptiness, in emptiness
bow to me faithfully
bow to me splendidly
gathered for a sacred rite
subconscious minds allied
call upon immortals
call upon the oldest ones to intercede
rid us of our human waste
cleanse our earthly lives
make us one with darkness
enlighten us to your ways
from churning worlds of mindlessness
come screams unheard before
haunting voices fill the room
their source remaining undefined
shadows cast from faceless beings
lost for centuries
lords of death, i summon you
reside within our brains
cast your spells upon our lives
so that we may receive
the gift of immortality
bestowed on those who seek you
gathered for a sacred rite
subconscious minds allied
call upon immortals
call upon the oldest ones to intercede
rid us of our human waste
cleanse our earthly lives
make us one with darkness
enlighten us to your ways
lords of death, i summon you
reside within our brains
cast your spells upon our lives
so that we may receive
the gift of immortality
bestowed on those who seek you
immortal rites
life betrayal a warping rage
evil ripping caverns through your mind
immolation in blood you've signed your soul away
sickening life ends but the horror has just begun
vultures moaning a funeral dirge
walls await to cradle you and rip your soul apart
incessant screaming echoes through the maze
insanity approaches imminent demise
maze of torment
maze of torment
maze of torment
maze of death
stricken from the holy book deliverance to pain
effigy of jesus christ burning in your mind
voices cry out to bid you welcome
locked within the dungeons of darkness no escape!!
maze of torment
maze of torment
maze of torment
in the name
passing through corridors embedded with
scars of those who have gone before you
and left their marks
warning comes too late to save you now
visions of suffering stab from the inside
you pray for death
mourning does no good as you can only die once
souls are being raped by the maze
lost in these halls, endlessly
maze of torment
maze of torment
maze of torment
maze of death

ninnghizhidda hear my cries
plumed serpent of the deep
plumed serpent of the gate
i command come before me
i command bring the key
rise from the depths

ia iak sakkakh iak sakkakth

i call forth the god pazuzu
i call forth the lord of plague

creatures of spawn of hate
rejoice in the heaving earth
praise the ripping sky

they've come to bring us gifts
they've come to make us whole
they've come to bring us god
their gift of heaven
they've come to make us civil
their gifts as ransom
their god comes with a cost
we must give up all
for prayers in a foreign tongue
to a foreign throne
erase our traditions
erase our way of being
erase our elders' teachings
erase, replace these ways
generations of wisdom
in exchange for ransom
your god comes with a cost
a cost to us all
prayers in a foreign tongue to
a god unknown
from demons, you will never see
prayers that will save your soul
blessed are the children
we have come to save them all
we came to cure disease
that has never made you ill
we came to make you clean
to protect you from yourself
they've come to bring us hope
they've come to save our souls
they've come to make us holy
they've come to give us heaven
they've come to make us civil
just like them
their god comes with a cost
and we must give up
all of our traditions
erase our way of being
erase our elders' teachings
erase, replace these ways
generations of wisdom
they have taken away
our culture has been erased
bring every child they blessed
with the needle's mark
chop off every little arm
let the children bleed
hot wind burns me
burning as i fall
cast away
speechless in the holy way
i survive
the scourge and banishing
to scorching land
i am lord, i take command
forgive me not
this knowledge makes me strong
to resurrect
the cities of the damned
all the treasures of sodom
now belong to me celebrate
fallen angels take my hand
fall from grace
whores long for my flesh
and my desire
lust anointing me now
consume my soul
i writhe in the flesh and the sins of hell
i am belial
i bend my knees not before my selfish desire
laugh at the tragedies
mock with disrespect
goats under rule of father time
leaches pass judgement on their fellow kind
and die when their inner self goes astray
alas, i pay homage to the ancient ones
speak my name!
raise the staff of the morbid priest
descend into the fires of the true law
suffocating evil smoke arise
cleansing the masses in iniquity
cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
vile crematory burns my eyes
mortals filled with despair
they quest to foresee their fate
caverns below await the wine to flow
rape the harvest of souls
i watch in awe as the crucifiers march
killing time, killing all i see
another moon rise, human waste
screaming: "why hath thou forsaken me?"
suffocating evil smoke arise
cleansing the masses in iniquity
cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
vile crematory burns my eyes
it's the dawn of the crucifiers
suffocation
it's the dawn of the crucifiers
suffocation
suffocating evil smoke arise
cleansing the masses in iniquity
cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
vile crematory burns my eyes
we stand defiant
in this great big ugly world
do believe that the chaos
was our one true calling
first we muscled fate
then we brazenly call disorder
watch the normals cower
they just can't take it anymore
withstand together now
all the damning from on high
fist horns are roaring forth
as i scream into the sky
i'm morbid
morbid and
sordid
distorted
bring them to their knees
i'm morbid
morbid
won't be thwarted
from celebrating morbid victories
we're seen as monsters, merely being...
is a threat to all
what can't destroy us makes us strong
and in a twisted mind
oh everything is possible
and in a twist of fate
we make it all come down...crumbling down
oh we'll bring them down
we stand invincible not just a dream
straight from the underground we scream
i'm morbid...
we stand invincible not just a dream
straight from the underground
the gods are screaming
tear down the obstacles this is our way
we're born to quake the world
there is no other way
i'm morbid...
havohej another me born to serve
to plague and moan
so many years my seed condemned
no free to soar!
will is yours? so creator
no intent could shadow
my disease ... ever lusting pain
world of sickness
blessed are we to taste life of sin
my touch is inhumane
nocturnal beast inside
is void of light
and empty shall remain
world of sickness
blessed are we to taste life of sin
confront me unholy ones
bastard saints scorn of the earth
i summon thee now poison me
death under will burn in my soul
exalt me enemies of the lamb
intrude we are of one
under will, i walk the path of sin
with your spells i die again
raise me from mortal
my will be your will
my words speak your words
your pains raise me to bliss
what of this anger now
received to lance your enemy
i feel the energy
the poison moves in me
i spill blood
come alive, i witness
in rapture i'm born again
come alive, i bear scorn
in rapture i'm reborn
confront me unholy ones
intrude we are of one
under will, i walk the path of sin
with your spells i die again
i am the god of gods
master of the arts
i desecrate the chaste
writhe in the flesh
blasphemy
chant the blasphemy
mockery of the messiah
we curse the holy ghost
enslaver of the weak
god of lies and greed
god of hypocrisy
we laugh at your bastard child
no god shall come before me
blaspheme the ghost
blaspheme the ghost
blaspheme the ghost
blasphemy of the holy ghost
do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
rebel against the church
drink from the chalice of blasphemy
rise up against the enslaver
blasphemy
chant the blasphemy
mockery of the messiah
we curse the holy ghost
enslaver of the weak
god of lies and greed
god of hypocrisy
we laugh at your bastard child
no god shall come before me
blaspheme the ghost
blaspheme the ghost
blaspheme the ghost
blasphemy of the holy ghost
do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
rebel against the church
drink from the chalice of blasphemy
rise up against the enslaver
blasphemy
a call to take your hand
for i'm one with the dark
how dare you come for me
and again you must die
so ancient curse known to me
behold the powers i unleash
upon your throne
know my words, feel my hate descend
lord of light
i will swarm against you now
gods perverse
wickeds at my side
misery
thorns to lance your every word
nazarene
now i crown you king in pain
suffer
dark eyes, shadows grim
they come for me
midnight chimes, blackened earth
the evils rise
pits of hate open wide
chasms of my dreams
last of chimes monks arrive
and take my mind again
waste polluted memories
acid rivers flow
vigil for this land's decay
sounding from below
dogs of war, satan's own
plotting all their sins
weapons aimed at liberty
my vision no one wins
take my mind
all the way
the darkside calls
i shan't resist
men forever rot in pain
mind machines control
toxic rains scouring brains
victimizing souls
winds of war suffocate
voodoo in the sky
breathe the gases, breathe no more
my vision all will die
take my mind
all the way
the darkside calls
i shan't resist
cut myself and release the blood
pains of a thousand years
pathic sights journey's end
descent into another world
my time has come to meet the
masters . . . all the corporate lords
i'm not afraid to face all their
trials slavery in the end they'll
still have no power over me
daylight shines blind my eyes
waken to another day
tribulation now has passed
but the dreams remain
walls of sleep fade away
abandonment of wonders
monks of knowledge bid farewell
and leave me with these visions
from the darkside
visions
from the darkside
no god will claim this garden
too sickening to the eyes to see this
long ignored my words of warning
from the world i built, erased
so it shall know no peace in my time
in absence of my voice for guidance
in the absence of my hand and whip
grew the absence of the knowing
unknowing
grew the absence and grew the festering
a boiling abscess that
was sure to burst with failure
from a distance i have observed
minding my slaves like children
absorbing your petty struggles
disgusted by your petty lives
i have witnessed your sleight of hand
i was betrayed by you many times
i have craved to bring forth my vengeance
i have yearned to dismantle this
world of unfathomed treasures
this garden disgraced by man
your ways despised by beasts and gods alike
all gods agree your ways must end
they have waited long to see this
you claim to not need my guidance
yet you reach for my hand and plead
obsessed with your futile struggles
you are mistaken to think i feel
from a distance i have observed
minding my slaves like children
absorbing your petty strife
disgusted by your petty life
all gods have left this garden
these gods have left in shame
dismissed and long forgotten
this world of useless being
this endless festering
bred from the bowels
sheep one and all
bound by the doctrine of lies
to fucked human shit
i shout blasphemy
as i make my way
thru to the promised land
smell of shit is so foul
writhe in disgust
earth heaves and death comes to call
all the waste cling to your lie
you are as sand and the wind blows
my disgust a fever
to kill a thousand more
gene dead from birth
god's holy fuck
canonized but of no use to me
human shit, untermensch
waste begone from my earth
desolation no life bodies littering
beast of earth devour
cleanse this world for those who deserve
burning cities, all is well
i remain in my conviction
as the waste in sewer flows
thru the promised land
caught within my evil spell
now its time to burn in hell
you were fooled no return
you're just a doll for him to burn
see the reaper in his eyes
messenger prince of flies
brain washed with sin and death
time to burn my evil wrath
evil spells
evil spells
bring the children down to burn
once you fall no return
sin takes you by surprise
on this backwards hellbound ride
gates of hell drawing near
satan loves the taste of fear
quenching all with black desire
burn your souls in furnace fire
evil spells
evil spells
evil spells of the dead
messengers of your death
falling endless in your tomb
locked within infernal doom
see the reaper in my eyes
messenger prince of flies
warlock's voice surrounds your dreams
baking soul within your screams
evil spells
evil spells
churning sea of absu
place of weeping death
tiamat, dark serpent
lord of the morbid priests
enraged with hate for god
the priests of chaos chant
from the book of the worm
they burn the symbols of christ
we spit on the virgin lamb
and mock the words he spoke
his ways not worthy of me
we choose to burn in the pits of hell
wreakers of death and havoc
inflicting never ending pain
sing the words of emptiness
formulas of death
call the queens of hell
and the god of the dead
the sea of absu rolls
rising spirit of nar-marratuk!!!
bow down before the master
and pray the defeat of god dog
prayer of the ensnarers
blind fiends of chaos rule
rise up o powers of the sea
in the name of absu i call
come and carry my curse
to the ones who me disgust
may they burn in my cauldron
for they are as molten wax
so made it be
liars in wait, priests of the night
make images to burn by the moon
robbing the spirit, raping god's law
send up our hate to burn heaven's gate
churning sea of absu
place of weeping death
tiamat, dark serpent
lord of the morbid priests
enraged with hate for god
the priests of chaos chant
from the book of the worm
they burn the symbols of christ
bow down before the master
and pray the defeat of god dog
prayer of the ensnarers
blind fiends of chaos rule
rise up o powers of the sea
in the name of absu i call
come and carry my curse
to the ones who me disgust
may they burn in my cauldron
for they are as molten wax
so made it be
liars in wait, priests of the night
make images to burn by the moon
robbing the spirit, raping god's law
send up our hate to burn heaven's gate
gods transform me
this storm will cleanse me
civilized i shall not be
by this holy strain of laws
i fall below the earth
i smell the ancients' breath
the fiends encircle me
they speak my name in tongues
for i'm no human now
i burn the ways conform
the gods are pleased with me
they speak my name in tongues
i'm the seer
i know the texts divine
thunder words
demons race into my eyes
azazel, lend to me your wings of twelve
i shall fly into the storm
i, son of fire, in anger become
the lightning bolts that strike the earth
i'm the seer
i know the texts divine
thunder words
demons race into my eyes
locked deep beyond the gate
lost within the stars
realm of the ancient ones
malignant ones
against the light
power of the blackened sky
hateful spawn "we are the chasm depths"
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
a scorn from the absu
kutulu snaps his jaws
cauldron burns and receives
crushing the voice of the tyrants
raise the horns in blasphemy
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
a scorn from the absu
kutulu snaps his jaws
cauldron burns and receives
crushing the voice of the tyrants
raise the horns in blasphemy
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
your plastic souls melt within cauldrons burning black
chanting to the ancient ones, chants of broken lines
kneel before the altar, sacrifice is made
it is pleasing to the ones most ancient of the days
they call the prince of disease, messenger of the absu
carry through the icy winds our curse upon their church
hanging helpless above the pentagram
sacrifice swings within leather noose
sing the ancient hymn that makes the absu roll
raise the rusty knife, let loose the blood of kingu
sudden death throws off the balance that's within the sky
priest calls forth infernal names to the ones beyond the gate
angel of disease one who shuns the light
shub niggurath goat with one thousand young
praise the beast, the chanting grew
praise the beast with virgin blood
praise the beast with soul and mind
praise the beast and show the sign
bind their kings in iron chains
execute the judgment for them
come and taste the fleshy pleasures
orgies of endless time
beneath the rolling for hate ignites their eyes
from their graves the dead rise to answer nammtar's call
on a twisted cross the virgin corpse hangs
they blacken out the sun and burn the elder gods
morbid priest calling forth
abominations of the sky
kutulu meets in the void
ancient ones rule once more
beasts awaiting, restless
circus victims panic struck
hunger spawns bestial frenzy
commencement of the feast
by the sign of the cross
whips crack
centurions might be known
christians standing breathless
circus victims panic struck
scream arena butchery
where is their god
as the faithful meet their end?
judgment has passed
who questions this law?
pagan belief of sacrifice
kill them all
kill them all for slander
kill them all and mute their ways
kill them all
kill them all for slander
kill them all and mute their ways
judgment has passed
who questions this law?
pagan belief of sacrifice
evil minds grievious sins
pagan lives have no place for law
twisted worship exhume the dead
minds unite for evil cause
death corrodes the book once strong
evil lourd destroys his foes
plague has spread throughout the land
revelations have begun
call of evil's mastermind
christians flock to the beast
burning crosses burn souls
exterminate the altar of laws
atrocities of a new reich
holy war and holocaust
god weeps and turns his back
the time is right to destroy the world
damnation
fill the world with plague
force of devastation
tyranny from above
damnation
fill the world with plague
force of devastation
tyranny from above
churning cities lust so profane
driving the will to destroy
crippling powers i'm forced to partake
unholy rituals
crimes of a world barely alive
melting debauchery
ashes to ashes, so must i be
lost in this misery
there's nothing left here for me
i know of no other way
even death cannot change my ways
i'm first in the line
to hell we shall go
calls of evils mastermind
christians flock to the beast
burning crosses burn souls
time is right to destroy the world
damnation
fill the world with plague
force of devastation
tyranny from above
gone is the will, gone is the time
the ways of the righteous
again we will never see them
gone is the strength, gone is the courage
to deny these treasures
gone is the way of every king
to no kings have we prayed
to no kings do we bow down
to no prayers do we yield our cleansing
your gods rejoice in your end
hear us sing
of man in eulogy
hear us sing
mocking the gods and their heresy
hear us sing
in glory of how it soon will be
hear us sing
mourning no gods, for they will know defeat
gone is their pride, gone is their hate
gone is every witness
gone is the need to decide
gone is all life, gone is the tumor
that is human being
gone is the need for their gods
with no gods do we feast
from no gods do we cower
no prayer will yield our cleansing
this fate no god would change
hear us sing
hear us sing
with no gods do we feast
from no gods do we cower
no prayer will yield our cleansing
this fate no god would change
i stand before thee, gods of all prestine
come forth to see, all things to be seen
now know the presence, and choose thy wrath
for flock of tyrants, who know not thy path
come now in sweeping vengeance
come now in needed time
i demand as i stand before you
cleanse this worlds decay
i demand to know the light of a promised land
i demand to see this corrosion wiped away
and the slithering begins
as the shell of men crawl weeping
and as the light of dawn is growing
the realization sets in
and with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
that the ways of the shallow empty
have brought it down
the winds that are blowing
shall bring it down
and while your clinging
to the ways of your worthless life
your words is falling
you are left with nothing
and with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
your ways so shallow and empty
have brought it down
your ignorant haze
has brought it down
return these days to the righteous
heal these wounds of time
i have waited so long
for the winds of change to come
through eyes still clear
through eyes not dulled by fear
through eyes behind the soul
i see what must be...
i demand to know the light of a promised land
i demand to see this corruption wiped away
come to me, lord of filth
hear my cries princes of nightmares
touch us with your morbid lips
let us taste your foulness
bleed for the devil
impious mortal lives
feel the enticing power
fill the chasm of your soul
fill the air with the smell of death
grace us with your magick
fill the night with the stench of evil
i summon forth the beast
bleed for the devil
impious mortal lives
feel the enticing power
fill the chasm of your soul
cold look in his eyes
he holds the gleaming knife
girl cries as he cuts away the
strips of flesh
bleed for the devil
impious mortal lives
feel the enticing power
fill the chasm of your soul
eyes to see
ears to hear
darkness swallowing all in its path
the blind leading the blind and the "flock" is ever confused
who has the gift of healthy sight and mind
who can withstand while the others are blown away?
eyes to see
what the others see not
ears to hear
the voice of the elders guides
eyes to see
and the blind; they wither away
you fools! these eyes are never for you
darkness corrupting all in its path
greed leading the man to blindness, suffering
and ever foretold
the meek shall have this earth
alas without sight they will only be left with demise
worlds apart are they and i
my world remains in sight
their lives despair
the "i's" and "they's" cannot compare
how can you defeat that which finds
nourishment in your attack?
how can you kill that which
finds sanctuary in your blade?
how can you hinder that which
embraces the strategies against it?
you can take nothing from not
in my being, nothing is
nothing becomes
nothing is not
in your world, all things return to me
i'm the collector of soul
for they're never past my control
i take of what is and nothing of that i give
i'm the alpha omega
my way in itself, complete
i am the continuum
human, meagerness of purpose
come feed me what i please
my spirit shan't be hindered
for it knows no weakess
i dine on your pain
your strength is only that of men
human, why do you clutch your flesh so?
in my being i am
i will
i create
in your world all things return to me
cold finger on the trigger
behind the line drawn in the sand
anger rise!
we fight a war with much at stake
the rights of birth that no one can take
overflowing with anger
a soon to be awakening
will be martyrs on to glory
dawn finds us in this rage
my finger on the button
with what's so foreign in my sights
anger rise!
we wage a war
our nature to preserve
by any means
our enemies be gone
no longer can we wait
as an enemy drains our future
as the light of a new day shines
our anger fuels our march this dawn
as it must be
this dawn of the mad
call of duty
all the minutemen rise and shine
call of duty
only sovereigns stand the test of time
restless minds beneath the ground
through ghostly winds i hear the sound
crying forth in ancient tongues
eternal quest of vengeance
from tombs of scorn cadavers rise
angered fury in their eyes
solemn rage, a need to kill
feasting on holy hordes
evil curse is carried forth zombies rage
burning holy images in life they were
forced to hail
eternal flames have purified their souls
born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom come
twisted oath nodebliwith
preying on those who seek the cross
let none be pardoned for their crimes
feeble race will die
scripture burns in infamy
tortured souls have been set free
taunting he who sits on high
pray thy kingdom come
evil curse is carried forth zombies rage
burning holy images in life they were
forced to hail
eternal flames have purified their souls
born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom come
banished from the living
bodies long decayed
mass of resurrection
sepulchers abandoned
insurgent souls arise
disseminating evil
curse of devistation
implored by hells command
darkness rips the land
morbid priests serenity
sing praise
thy kingdom is at hand
twisted oath nodebliwith
preying on those who seek the cross
let none be pardoned for their crimes
feeble race will die
scripture burns in infamy
tortured souls have been set free
taunting he who sits on high
pray thy kingdom come
evil curse is carried forth zombies rage
burning holy images in life they were
forced to hail
eternal flames have purified their souls
born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom come
naught within this circle
all but emptiness expelled
i am deep in wicked
and whore to demons works
master i call thee
master surround me
with evil in our hearts
this night we take revenge
mote it be
satan's sword i have become
no son shall escape
no word left unburned
the power is in me
hellspawn in aeturnum
i burn with hate
to rid this world of the nazarene
this night of splendor
the beast arise in me
this is my destiny
my sword shall take life
release this fury
malediction
cursed existence
writhing in this life of dissent
pain for pleasure
pain for adoration
pain is to godliness
bleeding for ecstasy
divine
pain divine
locked in vicious
offer to the sado-gods
nails driven through my dreams
bleeding pain is a god's reward
gliding through these dungeons
heightened senses overwhelmed
hedonistic rupture
endurance makes one divine
divine
pain divine
locked in vicious
offer to the sado-gods
nails driven through my dreams
bleeding pain is a god's reward
bring before me anyone who opposes my name
bring before me any voice that speaks in disdain of me
bring before me any force that would challenge my will
bring before me every vessel that is filled with doubt
erase them from my kingdom
we have no way to feed them
burn down every home that keeps them safe at night
rape them as you wish their daughters
feed the wolves their mothers, erase them
make sure that every father sees his son die, before he bleeds
erase them and let the kingdom see it
erase them
take the gold and burn the rest
torture any fool that does not submit
erase them
have them swear devotion, then cut out their tongue
torture any fool that does not submit
make them believe in this
secured limitations
you created this thing you call sin
a guide for the undisciplined sheep
through the pain and denial the pleasure reaped
a freedom contained within a shell
and all that's without you call hell
you scorn our existence
unclean despising our ways
shall the unclean come and infect you
for our ways, disheveling your hold
and the random perplexing the fled
behind the walls of concrete, they hide
secured limitations
from uncertainties the god-mind knows
and from the nothingness, all the wines flow
the affluence, the-mother's gift
but you can't, through the concrete
you scorn our existence
unclean despising our ways
shall the unclean come and inflect you
for the heathens have chosen a different light
and the vision of the all through the inner sight
for the freedoms and prisons are in the mind
secured limitations
from the uncertainties the god-mind knows
and from the nothingness all the wines flow
the affluence, the god-mother's gift
but you can't see, through the concrete
rise through the gate, iak sakkath
from depths beyond the sky
the realm of evil gods
painful... they eat your mind
evil in disguise
breathe in pain
blackened souls remain
ghouls who pray the death of god
destroy jehovah's church
vomit upon the cross
and burn the book of lies
evil in disguise
breathe in pain
blackened souls remain
ghouls who pray the death of god
destroy jehovah's church
vomit upon the cross
and burn the book of lies
evil in disguise
breathe in pain
blackened souls remain
yog sothoth evil one
come forth and taste the blood
infant entrails
are hung upon the twisted cross
evil in disguise
breathe in pain
blackened souls remain
shards of broken machinery
gears dislodged and flailing
flesh gives steel no challenge
bones cannot withstand
blades will smash resistance
chains will drive the hunting of the flesh
slick through the skin straight to the soul
leaving no breathing man alive
kill them all
knock down their walls, flatten their homes
leaving no place for the humans to hide
kill them all
burn every bridge
scorch every crop in case one survives
kill them all
burn every one
grind their bones to dust
mere flesh cannot withstand us
we have come to wipe this planet clean
to end your consumption
mere flesh cannot withstand me
i've come to wipe this planet clean
to clean to burn to grind
blades will smash resistance
chains will drive the hunting of the flesh
with swipe of hand release disease
exonerate their thoughts of gods
at odds with what they see
with slam of fist to flesh of earth
discharge your breath of
molten poison, scorch their lungs
i am all prophecies fulfilled
yet you refuse too see this
you mock my name, have you forgotten?
i am the truths that were lost, taught
as myths and buried in earth
the soil won't hide the warning signs
my art, to bring demise
my skill, it is necessity
my will, exists through time
it's my rite, to rid this world of life
my presence means demise
i relinquish kings of power
my course to disassemble life
to embellish while you cower
i am proof that all denied, was scripted
for all to know this
thus all who closed their eyes
will pray now to have witnessed this
with abandon, they have tarnished
in ignorance they devour
consumed by the lust of owning all
their slavery, their bliss
they are repulsed by the gifts we have given
they cannot hold them in their hands
these fools have felt unsettled
shall stay and watch it as it burns
i am the architect
it is my design to betroth this earth
you called my name
have you forgotten?
i am the builder of all loss
i am the keeper at all cost
the soil, the air, are my creations
and i shall watch them burn
i am the architect
i am the un existence
you know my name!
you have not forgotten!
i am creator of this world
i am the keeper of the soil
the soil won't hide
the warning signs
i am all prophecies fulfilled
yet you refuse to see this
you mock my name
i have not forgotten!
i am the truths that were lost
taught as myths and buried in earth
the soil, the air, are my creations
weak aside no place for those our struggle
leaves behind
our lord won't tolerate those whom through
attrition fall
we must dominate
with iron through our veins and a will made so elite
hunting for our daily bread and the sinister close in sight
hunger always drives the beast and the women fall prey
leading all the wonders to certain fate
another victim reviled
i'm staring at you through the eyes of the wolf
tell me who is going to save you now!
animal senses ever alert
praise be to the father-war
as a servant i am serving myself and i bathe in anticipation
unless you taste it you could never know
all the power our lord bestows
with a bow and a kiss profane
be a victor or be a victim
to amend any treasons of the truth
or of the soul
we the gods of all things share witness
so be it the law
that any being beneath our skies shall
know our mercy when it is earned
and shall know the wrath of the gods
when it is deserved
now we decide
these feeble yet volatile human beings have menaced
beyond what is acceptable
their yearning to self consume in misery
has made them every bit expendable
their reasoning brings questions of their
understanding, their truth is anything
but logical and i suspect that the facts
will show beyond a doubt, the evidence is clear to see
i share your hatred and i share in your disgust
i second the motion, beyond a doubt, they are expendable to us
release all demons of the underworld, release the wrath of all our kin
unleash the demons beneath the soil, let this cleansing now begin
now come our fury upon this world
now come to bring upon them endless night
resolve this land of these succubi
these humans, this burden
awaken my brothers
of vengeance we rise
to devulge this enemy
to enlighten the ones who sleep
worlds have passed and so too has time
my slumber now disturbed
this place of hate, thy worlds shall burn
humans, i shall feast upon your ignorance
you will destroy yourselves
mortals, your slithering existence
sickens the gods, my brothers
it awoke me, from timeless sleep
my dreams destroyed, my visions lost
and so i watch you pray
and spite your worlds
forgive me father? i am not your god
you crawl to me, and beg to me my sheep
you have fallen, curse your empty lives
blind, like wolves you turn on yourselves
the lines have long been drawn
between the life and death
the right and wrong
but what's the reason
what's our reason?
the walls are high we know
they've gotta come down
'cause we've been crossing the line since 1989
we're moving the world
because our power is a shining
sick groove with fu**ing magic to prove that
the radicals are here to stay!
we're living hardcore and radical
we'll always be maniacal and animal
they fear us cause we're physical irrational
our radi-killer kult is thriving!
setting fire to everything we see
fill the rage inside the music... what will be
given reason then taken away
because the boundaries are coming down...
'cause though we live
and breathe we're like nasty machines
taking out targets and we do it with ease
we've been called
we scream back never the same
and we tear it up as radicals!
we're banging hardcore radical
maniacal and animal
beast stomping with an appetite insatiable
we are the radikult...
we're living hardcore and radical
we'll always be maniacal and animal
they fear us cause we're physical irrational
our radikult is thriving!
bang it hardcore and radical
maniacal and like an animal
beasts stomping with an appetite insatiable
we are the radikult...
our beats down
one step close to the fiery end
just take another dose of our insane world
it all gets better
feel next to nothing 'til we drop it again
radical
radikul
never made to order unpredictable
demoniacal and so fanatical are the
zealots and the martyrs of the radikult
war
kills on the land
blood
saturates
this hallowed ground
to which my fathers fell
rebel souls
buried deep beneath
this hallowed ground
land of my ancestry
drink the blood
rebel lands rise again
war-death lingering
blood rivers flow
in sacrifice
unholy war
implored from below
no peace as
rebel lands rise
quaking below my feet
mortals shall suffer defeat
forgotten evils below
rejoice as the blood flows
sacred night on the eve of may
we gather before the stars
taste the hunger of the fire
vastness of the continuum
heretics of a way unseen
celebrate, the greatest of means
beelzebub, lord of the flies
by your hand the zamanu dies
drink, drink, the blood of the ancients
me-zu me pa-ku-ku-de-hul
(your divine ordering principle is a divine order which manifests itself with
most sweetness)
star encircled with the power-names
we speak in the broken lines
leviathan will open the gate
to the great abyssous planes
feel the icing winds of the ab-zu
sea below all seas
leviathan, serpent of truth
share with us most perfect way
call to the earth, fortify our will
come air spirits, be our eyes this night
primal flames are warmth to our souls
waters of life, great blessings you pour
calling on leviathan
open the gate
link us with the wonder of the abyss planes so great
lord of the rolling thunder
celebrate with us this night
rip away the veil
hear our praise
your slumber is our paradise
you smite our enemies down
for we, the few enlightened
through your will we break our bonds
lord who shatters paradigms
from the rubble the new shall rise
your way presents death for them
the me-gal-gal do we praise
come centaur
those who prance to the hymns of truth
come join us
come leviathan
make passage of the entrance we've
prepared for you this night

(translation:)
lady of splendour, it is thine loving embrace
sweet nectar for which i forever thirst
heavenly lady, i hunger
it is thine kiss of divinty for which i hunger
kingdoms infamous for taking as they please
to appease a voice of righteousness
infidels and heretics, enemies of our light
shall be dealt with in the name of god
it is the rite of our kind to silence any tongue
that would try to oppose the king of our land
bring us their heads as trophies of our victories
praise us and align as soldiers of a destiny
foretold by ancient prophets
bring us new lands, these people too will praise us
praise our god or meet your own
it matters not to us, we have glory either way
bow down before our king
fear is your new faith, fear is your new doctrine
be docile until we say, be ready with your life
if the king needs you to die
bring us their head as trophies of our victories
praise us and align as soldiers of a destiny
foretold by ancient prophets
bring us new lands, these people too will praise us
the followers of ancient ways shall be taught to follow us
or be beaten to their fate
the kingdom does not accept any praise of other lands
it will be treated as an act of war
you exist because we allow it, so kneel to show your god
it is us that you fear
prepare to learn the ways of this new kingdom
prepare to swear your soul and life to keep it
prepare to give yourself to do our bidding
prepare to sacrifice for our desire
omniscient are the eyes that see beyond
what we choose to see
transcending of beliefs, that limit man's being
the dogma that feeds the listless
has thrived uncounted years
impeding on ones perception
of what is to be
awaken to see
a god of a desertion
a god of lies
enlightened by a way, deceiving
only truth to the blind
the salvation that you seek is empty
no god of light
the venom that has fed your faith
you except with ease
but the sights that lay before you
destroy your beliefs
awaken to be
at one with nothing
now all will be seen
the seeds of the weak destroy
the lies told of forgiving, exposed
the ignorant, thrown to the wake
your calling names of gods
they are only shrines
the waves of the truth, enslave
slaying the blind
awaken to a light of knowing
all your truth was lies
and the faith which you embraced
has left you blind
deceived like the fools that surround you
it came with ease unfulfilled were the days of your being
but now you will see
death to my vision
blind i shall serve
give rise to god war
watch the civils fall
hateful seed inside me
scald my mind of all but truth
i concede; i am the chosen one
open wide the gate
stain the world with the blood of man
affliction
forced unto all
human vexation
transcend with blood on my hands
spirits of the grave remember
rise up o' powers from the land of til
plague and madness spread thru this world
burn in me for i suffer your will

terror
your battle roar seeds
terror
no shield can withstand
the seven weapons of flame
the principal force that you wield
captive
the hostile ones are held
captive
the insubmissive are
brought to their knees
for they cannot counter
your massive assault upon them
the ill-natured
you've burned from our land
hostile gatherings you've tamed
you were unmatched
no counter could be found
with fury and flames
you scorched their aggressiveness
bil ur-sag lul-lu nig-hul tur

(translation:)
* bil ur-sag lul-lu nig-hul tur ha-elm zalag *
o lion-head, your awesome blaze of fire consumed the gathering of the
treacherous and the ill-natured. purifying them
* za-a-kam me-lam-ma-bi-du ki-bal-a su-sa *
it is thine aura, awful lights, overwhelming the enemy lands
* ur-sag zi-ga-ni naphar ajjabi sharush *
o lion-heads, with your most awesome rising power
destroyer of the gathering of the enemy gods
* sa-par-mah-zu diri la-magiru sin su-la *
your great net, being so enourmous swallowed the disobedient ones, binding
there hands
breathless i stand free
blind to fates which fall to men
embracing the chilling winds, still i am
the mist freeze falls from my breath
steel gray skies encompass my sight
caring not for other worlds
(and there are other worlds than these)
your fathers tried to slay me
your brothers fell before me
clashing, as hates collide
through echoed cried i wade
upon frozen ground, my victims lay
pounding the frozen earth
the hooves of horses carrying men
swords raised high
the rush of war flowing through their veins
the warm blood soon to meet the earth
from which it came
your fathers tried to slay me
your brothers fell before me
ageless, still i am
heathens, they bring their crusades to me
failing, they've come to die in vain
nameless, their meaningfulness is none
i summon the strength of the gods
and we are one
hear this, see this, know this
for this is the ways that it must be
for solace i eat the heart
to steal the power, this magic holds
and to taste the bitter vengeance
that within me has dwelled
men of kings have come to end me
only to die in vain
legends, have cursed my name
spells are spoken
believed to ward me away
your fathers tried to slay me
your brothers fell before me
ageless, still i am
just close your eyes
can you remember?
the generations not so long ago
i feel the shameless urge that we must restore
our former king to his rightful throne
and with me lords and maidens
we wait for the chosen son's return
i come alive
it's a time for celebration
our will to restore
make our past become the future once more
still he lives! 2000 years have passed
and still we're yearning for his return
we fulfill a wishful prophecy
and so the chanting begins:
hail caesar, hail caesar, we render unto you
what is still yours
share the wish as it must be
our king and palace
mode it be
gods enslaved, traitors burning
might and splendor forever return
spawn of the ever rolling abyss
ever espousing unluminous
charred soul burned at rebirth
quest not save the death of the sun
repulsed by the light
heart pumping ice
so cold to this world
reclude until the summoning
sworn to the black
our father begotten, not made
before all legends of man
receive my loyalty, my offering
in my veins; the blood of the ancient brood
summon me
burning inside, i feel the call
blood of the ancient ones now boils
at war war with the race
father rise and the world be one
repulsed by the light
no feeling for life
drained of my being
i lie dead but still i'm sworn
before that which is, all was not
less the sweet waters of habsu
chthhulhu amah-ushumgal-anna
triumvirate of most high
spirits of the deep waters, remember
humbaba, lord of the forest, remember
from the sweet bitter all that is came
creation of man and their gods
but man, fashioning overwhelm
could not see the light which he holds
spirits of purifying flames, remember
anunna, gods of the skies, remember
anunnaki, judges of ur, remember
anunnaki, weighers of the truth, be praised
the gift of flesh
was in fact life's curse
although born one in the same
in spirit, but the flesh all too coarse
discord, among the gods of men
although they were brothers
diversities grew
overshadowing their connection
on the clearest of days they are
one in the same
pettiest of purpose
degenerates things to their crudest form
being loathsome to habsu
zi-zi badur-ku-ku, kanpa
warring, in the belly of tiamat
brothers do battle
principalities of folly
disturb the mummu
the one who bore all was
appalled by their ways
her dream time was of no peace
their fleshly behavior
overbeating and proud
she despised them
zi zi anunnaki, kanpa
the ways of the underworld are perfect
not to be questioned by that of the brute
clearly beyond the understanding
of that which is ruled by the drives of the flesh
for whom shall then oppose
the lights of asag, purifying flames
come child, the anunnaki wait
truth is the weapon no pity it holds
the ways of the flesh
barbaric behavior patterns
flesh over spirit, the motivator of the worthless
the ways of the flesh
the evolution is minimal
i watch as your kingdoms rise and fall
causing no effective change
your military
command structure of impotence
a gross misuse of force
by leaders who lack in vision
your gods
evidence of your weakness
your focus is one with delusion
you worship that which means your end
rise up, o mahummuhu
the judgement is passed
the treachery is clear
they shalt become empty like the wind
the emptiest of shells so shall they be
o great mother
the armies shall rise with weapons
no pity they hold
from your great mummu
the serpents shall come
venom for blood
and the glory of gods
spirits of the flames, remember
anunna, gods of the skies, remember
anunnaki, judges of ur, remember
anunnaki, weighers of the truth, be praised
mahummuhu gal-gal
me-gal-gal-zu ga hul
amah-ushumgal-anna
me-gal-gal-zu ga hul
our darkest days have come
barbaric rules, self-serving
abandoned hope of gods
dismissed and long forgotten
our fate cannot be seen
prophetic fools have failed us
their visions long dispelled
they've fallen, like all idols
we demand a victor's feast
we demand that all shall know thee
we demand your end be praised
destroy all statues standing
built before you reign
tear them down in your name
disregard all existence
all kings before your time
they shall all be erased
you claim to desire peace
but if the truth be seen
you know us as your enemy
the ones that praise your grace
the fools that claim your glory
will watch the pillars fall
and see your kingdom burn
you called us impure heathens
you mocked our culture's ways
you forced disbelief upon us
by way of sword and blade
you ruled with hand of fury
you pillaged and you raped
none shall sing your praise
they claimed you as their savior
embraced your heinous ways
you proved yourself a failure
you swore to be the shelter
to shield is from the storm
yet, you brought this reign upon us
a shattered ego fallen
dismissed and soon forgotten
your name will be erased
we always were your enemy
and if the truth be seen
we brought your end of days
praise no man as savior
panic.......
this is your one warning...
pounding, pounding... you feel it
burning, burning this lave
scorching weakened hearts be troubled
they scream we're too extreme
we come to spread our insane
this doctrine chaos chaos
demanding nothing less but to
make you scream we're too extreme
tu corazón latiendo
te sientes el dolor
deseo la locura
tu gritas... extreme!!!
welcome to your new religion
we come collecting souls
you come to sing our praises
together selfless
we are your new religion
no religion
extreme!!
de sud america
a puertas de oro athens
a la quema inframundo

visión sufrirá
orejas derretirá
bese su nueva creencia
es nombre extreme
we are your new religion
no religion
you come to us in torment
and we make your bodies heave
our sounds invoke your demon
together too extreme!
these chains that have choked existence
have fallen away
this veil that has blinded eyes has been lifted
and now it is gone
and like the ways of the sheep
the flock has been to only receive
led to the gates of their enemy
led to the slaughter of their beliefs
and now their gazing eyes have turned
turned to see us laughing
these fools who have thought
us to be as they are
have never truly seen
guided by limiting the ways that they think
they thought us blind and obscene
but now the sheep are wailing
cries to a god they never see
and as the gates are closing
down upon the all they have believed
and now their pleading eyes have turned
turned to see the eyes of the laughing
the ties have bound these fools
to the ways of the blind
is ignorant bliss
lies that were fed to the slumbering mass
they've grazed upon it
and all that awaits men failing to see
is the sight they've despised
the gates have opened
your religion has died
our patience gone for your folly
there'll be no restraint
though it's been urged there's no warrant
to let you remain
ten thousand years
for a test you failed miserably
the target's locked
and this planet will soon be human free
march, march
... no hero should rise amongst you
... don't prolong your misery accept your fate
laser vision has monitored for centuries
we've gathered evidence
we know that you are disease
it matters not...
what counter measures you employ
you're not the first ones that we've destroyed
we take charge the task at hand
rid the third planet of life...
destroy man
we're marching
destructos marching on man
we're marching
destructos marching on!
we're marching
destructos marching on!
convoke the data
attack imminent
final closure on this failed earth experiment
it matters not...
what counter measures you employ
you're not the first ones that we've destroyed
we take charge the task at hand
rid the third planet of life...
destroy man
we're marching
destructos marching on man
we're marching
destructos marching on man
we're marching
destructos marching on man
we're marching
destructos marching on!
destroy man
we're marching
destructos marching on!
we destructos march
no mercy from annihilation
no mercy from destructo-nation
seek total annihilation
no mercy from destructo-nation
we're marching on
through the sordid human remains
the dead attest... your resistance in vain
ten thousand years and you never evolve?
it's over soon for humans one and all
the facts have shown all resources you waste
our eyes have seen all your greed and distaste
you feeble beings, just a blight to this earth
destructos marching on...
hatework
bringer of doom
hatework
what i have in store
what has the devil got to do with it
i'm brewing my toil
so the brimstone comes this way
nightwork
my life's work
nightwork
world in flames
this calls for fire
this is a call for ruin
we will be departed
leave the rot so lonely
hatework
bringer of doom
hatework
and the turmoil comes
hatework
my work
hatework
and the earth's left burning
i call death
death is answering me
my sour images dispelling all doubt
one sip of poison and my darkness comes out
like glass reflecting all the venom i see
my spirit taken task and now i will forever be
vulgore of the gory
vulgore for the glory glory
vulgore tells the ugly story
vulgore existo vulgoré
all the worldly deeds of malice displayed
from a wicked recipe this potion is made
each drop of future's bleak and calloused in view
sick clerics unprepared for vulgore i spew
i rejoice in awful ways
i sickly tune the worst of days
to have unreason's show to tell
all the world is a victim 'cause i'm rainsing hell
go gore the race is on to find a pure one
with simple subjects
oh this never could be fun
gore spreads a santo duelo como nino
feliz un día cuando gore golpea
hypocritical guidance has confused the masses
veiling the instinctive nature of a higher cause
accumulation and consuption
evaluated by your possessions
unabated cleansing of a deeper being
dissociative dissent, liberation through ignorance
disseminate devolution, dissipation of disruption
isolation and dejection, disenchanted exhilaration
discomposed reverence, subservient
constant denial of truth
constant distrust
constant obedience
this has spawned a new type of human
who live in fear and addiction
lead them
guide them to extinction
blessed be the one
the most ancient one
blessed be the one
who was here before and after remain
blessed be the meekness of the flesh
i watch as it withers and dies
come with storm
and blow the flesh from this earth
come with flood
and wash away the flesh from this earth
the mighty of this world
with the mighty of the flesh
but that of flesh
is crushed by that of the mountain
for it is written that
the future of flesh is dust
you are but a shell
your wine something unseen
come with fire
and burn the flesh of the earth
make the earth upheaval
may it swallow up the flesh of this earth
your dreams
mundane delusions of malkuth
my dreams
the continuum force that devours all things
dreams
that eat the flesh and drink the blood
uruku, my brothers
it is your time to feed
your will
empty promises you can't fulfill
my will
brings avalanches of abundance
power
of the gods circulate within my veins
i lie in wait, wait
being that erodes all things
blessed be the ones
the most ancient ones
blessed be the one
who was here before and after remain
blessed be the meekness of the flesh
i watch as it withers and dies
come with storm
and blow the flesh from this earth
come with flood
and wash away the flesh
come with fire
and burn the flesh of this earth
make the earth upheaval
may it swallow up the flesh of this earth
consequence
now the panic comes
you've dabbled in magic, your fingers are burned
lost as you run towards the light
and deep in your heart you have nothing but fear
your future is hanging by a strand
your master makes his just demands
game of life's price coming due
a swell of fear erupts in you
your time is now!
never a prayer, just silence rings
charity works won't change a thing
your balance of life is on our side
there's never a place to hide
what's so real is plain in sight
cost to play: eternal life
for when we play we play for keeps
satan's marks forever we speak
your time is now!
with screams you defy still silence rings
prayers to some god won't change a thing
gleam in your eyes reduced to tears
and deep in your heart you've nothing but fear
why object to "rewards" you know you've earned them
why reject all your fantasy
you can't betray what your works have bargained for you
no use to fear what you have in store
consequence
now the panic comes
you've dabbled in magic, your fingers are burned
lost as you run towards the light
and deep in your heart you have nothing but fear
what's so real is plain in sight
cost to play: eternal life
for when we play we play for keeps
satan's marks forever we speak
your time is now!
with screams you defy still silence rings
prayers to some god won't change a thing
gleam in your eyes reduced to tears
and deep in your heart you've nothing but fear
come burning
are you going to burn with me?
won't you come burning?
the world is watching
all the king's men riding hard
all their horses foaming
and if they were to catch us we'd be set ablaze
burn!
won't you come burning
all the dissident ones
come and walk the line and you will burn with me
witches yes, slaves never
and still i speak
a heretic amongst you
don't you let me live too long
burn!
could you imagine the pain
why would my country men let me down
they're bearing witness just to save their skin
that this might keep them from burning
they'd sell their mothers just to save their skin
that this might keep them alive
the marks i'm bearing are oh so deep
my will ingrained at birth
to flood true darkness with light and reverse
you'll see my covenant to keep
your judgment in the hands of the most inept
condemn those similar to burn with me
but the night is still young
i'm also feeling very bold
i think i'll do some burning of my own
oh the lines are getting longer
more are added everyday
and there seems to be no shortage
of humans for my foul play
no understanding
and no ability to see the signs
they just keep breeding out of order
and adding to the lines more and more
here they go
10 more dead
and the bodies piling higher, higher
10 more dead
and the stench grows stronger
with many more to go
most see me pure evil
but they respect me just the same
when nature's done sustaining
she calls me in to play the cold game
no favors
and no quarter ever shown
for the sheer masses of the masses
still t-s growing
more and more here they go
10 more dead
oh... come ye one come you all are waiting now
line up face the light
oh... and thousands more behind to follow
clueless
will be embers burning bright
oh they're dying for me quickly now
the ways are always mine to choose
'cause once it's done it doesn't matter
between the faith or fate i'm not confused
about my purpose no
reduce them all in shame
and the bones will pave my kingdom
they have only themselves to blame
here they go
10 more dead
why should we serve that which betrays
leeches, they steal of our lives
why should we lower ourselves to the beasts
submissive they are to be made
we need not to be held in their chains
illusions but they can still hold
we rise within the strength
the one who lays them to waste
praising the weapon that cleanses our land
so perfect it's way unopposed
punisher of the treacherous ones
u-mu la mah-ri
this force no bolt withstands
for it's now the merciless one
un-quenchable rage in holds
only sated when the last falls
their deeds of treason
unsees by the ones enchained
ignorance which shielded the crimes
all seen by the all knowing one
you'll perish within the hands
of the storm that means your end
these things you call your gods
these things, they save you not
oh now you live the torment
bound in the chains that enslaved us
now you feel the suffering
that you bestowed upon your being
live the pain of the gnashing teeth that's
grinding your bones enslaver
by what right did you bind us
now you'll reap the suffering
oh there's no mercy for you've
broken the sacred laws you've
taken the dreams of many
lives you have bound and punished
for your crimes no repentance
can turn back the wrath
which you've called on yourselves
by your deeds
no new life can arise
from a land once denounced
by my lord
for unrivaled he stands
for no man may rise up
to enslave any other
made free by design of our god
that of might shall
define what is right
for unmatched is the power
of chthhulhu most high
praising the weapon that cleanses our land
so perfect it's way unopposed
these things you praise as gods
these things, dispirited things
we assemble as those who were before
of the principal force and form
the lighting flash they are
they breathe the word and it becomes
we make the covenant
to the primal source of which we've come
we lift ourselves
on the path that brings us to our dream
the continuum force we praise
your slumber being our highest goal
we make your way our laws
for your me we do decide
amah-ushumgal-anna
deep within you hold the key
habsu being the way
to claim the throne that's ours by right
zamanu muh lal-li zi-pa-gurud-zuneme-e
igi-nu-du-a-hul igi-se-zid-gin
their treacherous decisions have committed them to
eternal dis and torment
for now their only shield
is the ignorance in which they hide
in the shadows of their fears
they feel the gnashing teeth and weeping
(translation:)
* zamanu muh lal-li zi-pa-gurud-zuneme-e *
hostile ones, you soon shall reap the reward you have earned
* igi-nu do-a-hul igi-se-zid-gin *
enjoy now this ignorant bliss in which you live
for the awakening soon shall come
decide, between the ways of the weak
the sheep, to live a lie
or to come to life, in victory we stand
above the meek
to raise the chalice and toast the conquering
to feast upon the spoils that we claim
we are wakening
we are the one you seek
we are the merciless
we are the all is truth
we await, the coming of days
the awakening of the eyes that sleep
the dawn of light for those of us who see
to stand above the shattered flock and their lies
for now it is our time
we are the conquering
we are the one you seek
we are the merciless
we are the all that is truth
victors...now hear me
brothers...as it must be
in victory we stand
our wake, our secret is broken
our legions now are one
the time of the silence now ended
in victory we stand
we are the conquering
the clearing out, the storm
born to be master of the world
fear my ever-pounding words
i desecrate, desecrate false idols heed my way
i'm graced with understanding
my gifts are awe demanding
collecting all the souls once lead astray
my will uncompromising
false gods are realizing
the bitter end of their lies now fades away
nevermore...
nevermore... my bastions oh so foul
we scream for more...
nevermore, nevermore!
long slumbering powers awaken
there will be no mistaking
i beacon all my rouges to taste the might
crush all the subjugates
dark will so concentrated
i'm scattering all the pieces
of their twisted fucking world
never again to see the light of day
nevermore...
it's time to prey we'll seize the day
i wear the scars from the path this way
my mind is something beyond the real
re-sculpt the throne
where my world will kneel
i'm the master of the world
none defy my pounding words
i desecrate, desecrate
false idols blown away
nevermore...
nevermore...
take the reigns with all my will and
scream for more
nevermore evermore!
empires and nations fall, caesars were men not gods
idols change as needed through time
generals are irrelevant without war
kings mean nothing without fools
to master
to feed their manic ego
to win their lusted plights
to follow with no caution
to follow to demise
mad men are praised and worshipped
enslavers victimize
torture, always their answer
to teach incessant hatred
the hand of god became filled with riches for only kings
the hand of kings became the will of men enslaved
depredate, restraint is not an option
this world has fallen, now scorched and barren
the rage of lunatics shall lead us nevermore
the hand, long forgotten, shall feed the blessed now
arise our ancient golom (defeat this enemy)
god strength upon the (the leach infested)
rise our ancients wisdom (bring your pestilence)
rectify, with haste your wrath awakened
malfeasance, you scorn this world
enshrined by grace, your shadows blinds the feeble
disentail the noble few
arise our ancient golom defeat this enemy
god strength upon the leach infested
rise our ancients wisdom destroy this wasteland
enshrined by grace devour this presceance
light the flame of redemption
ghouls attack the church
crush the holy priest
turning the cross towards hell
writhe in satan's flames
crush the priest
the feeble church
dead your god is dead
fools your god is dead
useless prayers of lies
behold satan's rise
crush the priest
the feeble church
the family of dog
lust upon my altar
demons attack with hate
satan in the fires of hell awaits
death against you all
god hear my death call
savagery as judgment days arrive
long we have waited for this time
how many brothers fallen?
how many kept alive as slaves for the wicked few?
'tis time for reparations
'tis time to settle scores
this time we give no warning
this means war!
savagery 'tis now our spirit overflows
war our minds are focused; we are one!
hear now the winds of change
a force to obviate
all the enemies naked now
all the smoke gone and all their mirrors are broken
lost empires crumble; destiny
behold! i crusader no retreat
years of complacency on the part of the mob
feeding on lies
so slothed, so full this is it
restless
and tolerance nearing its peak
woe to the next ones who push us to far
our love is now replaced by war
live cannot be spared, our victory at hand
and by my hand i slay the first
and the last will follow as we watch these wickeds bleed
no rest for the soldiers 'till the purge is done
no salvation until we drench this earth
i am the god of gods
master of the art
i desecrate the chaste
writhe in the flesh
blasphemy
chant the blasphemy
mockery of the messiah
we curse the holy ghost
enslaver of the weak
god of lies and greed
god of hypocrisy
we laugh at your bastard child
no god shall come before me
blaspheme the ghost
blasphemy of the holy ghost
do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
rebel against the church
drink from the chalice of blasphemy
rise up against the enslaver
one spills his blood for horror
choice alone to suffer
infernal voices calling
catastrophe no waiting
10 more encircled wailing
it's his existence glowing
blades for baal
demanding sharp and glistering slice
he can't fail
join them is the one device
we spill and poison ground
below the father's calling
his light will be unbound
once fallen angel spreads his wings
blades for baal...
two down on grounds unhallowed
with 9 more soon to follow
with reaches all but shallow...
purest of all intent
their candles burn both ends
their juices wind and rain... insane
blades for baal
demanding sharp and glistering slice
he can't fail
join them is the one device
blades for baal
all around me shining bright
life-trade for this
death to bring eternal night
blades for baal
... in the readings never found
of ways to keep this evil down
time unmasks the deepest seal
for all the cursed who choose to reveal
darkness takes another chance
luring to the ritual dance
collect the fallen necromance
and decidedly gathering all
give welcome torment
welcome blessing's fall
no crime just reason
just an end to all
mine is the one true baal
curse him no avail
he eats and drinks and burns you hail
so be the sacrifice
you really have no choice
our lives his only vice
give to him his drink then burn
blades for baal
blades for baal
blades for baal
i've seen visions awakening
drawing timeless life to an end
i've felt forces pulling me
and i have rejoiced in them
i've heard voices calling names
i have reveled in their beckoning
for the voices that summon me
have grown immense
my senses keen with desire and pain
senses heightened by my need to see
to feed the hunger that i feel inside
awake my soul to ecstasy
my father the forsaken
the king of blasphemy
they cower at your name
they live in ignorance
they hide behind a doctrine
that has taught them only lies
now let them see
thy world, immaculate
i've seen visions awakening
drawing timeless life to an end
i've felt forces pulling me
and i have rejoiced in them
i've heard voices calling my name
i have waited for their beckoning
for the voices that summon me
bring the gift of bliss
instrumental
locked deep beyond the gate
lost within the stars
realm of ancient ones
malignant ones
against the light
power of the blackened sky
hateful spawn
"we are the chasm depths"
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greed the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
a scorn from the absu
kutulu snaps his jaws
cauldron burns and receives
crushing the voice of the tyrants
raise the horns in blasphemy

being has overwhelmed the space between the silence of eternity
vision has intruded upon the light that pours through me, my energy
substance has veiled, the pleasures long lost, the beauty of emptiness
this very flesh confines, and spoils this demon's seed
waiting to light, a dead sky aflame
to suffocate, to rejoice in your misery
this waiting it seems, for so long i've yearned to see
the burning flesh of your humanity
your withering flesh, i've longed to see
may you fall to never again arise
may you cease to ever again be
may your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
pleading, churning, drowning
pleading, dying, burning
the treachery returns to the betraying eyes
your betrayers cries, fall to unyielding ears
and oh how it came to be, that you would pray to me
that you would beg to me, that this curse not come to be
that you would plead. that this curse not be released
may you fall to never again arise
may you cease to ever again be
may your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
pleading, churning, drowning
pleading, dying, burning
you give praise to the statues of gods
dispirited, they hear you not
you give offering to metal and stone
dispirited, how can they respond?
the faith disheveled
temples disdained
you praise the mere shadows of gods
the word, discolored and vain
and the gods, they know you not
they come when the spirit speaks
but your words disdainful
words spawned by the cultureless beings
disclaimed by the once attentive gods
disarmed, the power words are empty
your way being left to the winds
bitter is the wailing of the sheep
even now the memories are dis
barren, the temple's reason was loss
in vulgarian was it swallowed
the mundane, so disbanded they are
not of purpose can they find
the great mother, as if a criminal
disaffiliated from one's people
unwelcome like the rival of a culture
removed, unwelcome she stands
disarrayment of the values' core seeds discord
for now fulfillment cannot be formed
and the sheepfold mourn
in the forge of our will we manifest ourselves
empowering our world
yet the fables of a failed faith
show the effects of this spiritual dis
empty, the gods disavow you
understanding you have lost
for what fulfillment can you possibly hold
in the end of such means
caught in the chains you do not know
you hold the key to the truth
but these chains they dull you mind
shackled by the falsifiers
they share with you only the shadows of things
you commit to serve the mundane
society's slave but you can not see
the spirit so laden in the net of thorns
entrapped by the other's spells
i speak, but you're ignorant to me
can you not see what you hold
they respond to the potent will
of the most high standing
and being unchained by decision
assemblage of the ancient way
with incantations, manifesting our will
expanding our being
you're ripe for ensnare
your dreams and longings are beyond compare
call on me willing child
trade me your life for one without care
show me the wounds
exciting me now the closer you get
miss nothing your world so full of despair
you will never regret
i am all you will know
and it's deeper we go
gift me your soul... please me
deeper and deeper oh beauty meet your beast
bloody notes slurred
dreaming what's human becomes but a blur
oh beautiful child
come to me moist i'm the great connoisseur
woman you play this dangerous way
unknown, unalarmed
to majesty kneel
my allure makes you feel
your wounds are your charm
i am all you will know
and it's deeper we go
gift me your soul
and it's deeper and deeper we go
feel my embrace
and the deeper we flow
... and the beauty will grow
she falls deeper and deeper and deeper
... 'til beauty knows beast...
all the while your pleasure is here
no need to fear
don't look back
your pleasure is here
in my hands cavalier...
i am all that you know
and it's deeper we go
gift me your soul
and it's deeper and deeper we go
my embrace
found your beauty that grows
you're with me now
beauty i'm your beast
you are the one, the oldest one
you come before the legends of men
you come before the legends of gods
you are the sea, creator of all
you're all i need, for you i bleed
plant your seed, earth shall feed
enlighten my soul, spirit grows
born of the fire, i shall return
i am the hellspawn
curse from my eyes, your gods i defy
fulfillment is mine, of the most high
born of the fire, i shall return
answer the call of the oldest one
i am the hellspawn
forever i am, in spirit i am
forever i dream, continual dream
we sleep undisturbed again
chthhulhu we dream in the peace again
i am the hellspawn
travesty the way the wretched stand
upon the earth blind in their ignorance
embracing the slavery of their minds
soulless voids of being left wandering
take this blade of elohim
drain the life from within these fools
release the soul, from within the flesh
saviours your name we celebrate
forlorn, they shutter at their shrines
tortured by deities, they hold no revelance
enslaved by the weakness of their minds
their cripple prayers have left them smothering
seize this, the hand of our god
drain this life the burden of this fools
release the soul, from within the flesh
cleanse the soul, of their lives
cleanse the soul fo impurity
sickness unyielding pestilence
sickness infects of meek
sickness bound to deities
sickness formed by lies
travesty the way the wretched stand
upon the earth blind in their ignorance
embracing the slavery of their minds
soulless voids of being left wandering
[instrumental}
hollow lies fill weakened minds with
hollow dreams
weakened lives fill infamy with failed beliefs
shattered wills fall aimlessly beneath the hollow
hollow words can't fill the void beneath
within they seethe
again they breed
so callous
legends swollen, hallowed waste is stripped away
the venom growing with lust to feed the hollow need
return from ash, returning from a banished world
to savor flesh of the hollow, and all beneath
within they seethe
again they breed
no solace...
so callous...
so seething...
in this they feast

beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
through the ashes of the world consumed
enlightened by their hate
bathing in their lust
bleeding for the taste of revenge

festering deep inside manipulation
beyond the light, the shadow's fall, this prison's hold
awakened and growing, beyond what eyes can see
tasting the rebirth the crowning of our king
enlightened by their hate
bathing in their lust
bleeding for the taste of revenge
thriving in their hate
writhing in disgust
feasting on their weakness
we rise
the path of blind faith. the path of idolatry
their path of meekness
my wrath of sickness
my wrath of disease
my wraths dismantling
hope of life
beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
through the ashes of the world consumed

passing through corridors embedded with
scars of those who have gone before you

warning comes too late to save you now
visions of suffering stab from the inside

they've come to bring us gifts
they've come to make us whole
they've come to bring us god
their gift of heaven
they've come to make us civil
their gifts as ransom
their god comes with a cost
we must give up all
for prayers in a foreign tongue
to a foreign throne
erase our traditions
erase our way of being
erase our elders' teachings
erase, replace these ways
generations of wisdom
in exchange for ransom
your god comes with a cost
a cost to us all
prayers in a foreign tongue to
a god unknown
from demons, you will never see
prayers that will save your soul
blessed are the children
we have come to save them all
we came to cure disease
that has never made you ill
we came to make you clean
to protect you from yourself
they've come to bring us hope
they've come to save our souls
they've come to make us holy
they've come to give us heaven
they've come to make us civil
just like them
their god comes with a cost
and we must give up
all of our traditions
erase our way of being
erase our elders' teachings
erase, replace these ways
generations of wisdom
they have taken away
our culture has been erased
bring every child they blessed
with the needle's mark
chop off every little arm
let the children bleed
hot wind burns me
burning as i fall
cast away
speechless in the holy way
i survive
the scourge and banishing
to scorching land
i am lord, i take command
forgive me not
this knowledge makes me strong
to resurrect
the cities of the damned
all the treasures of sodom
now belong to me celebrate
fallen angels take my hand
fall from grace
whores long for my flesh
and my desire
lust anointing me now
consume my soul
i writhe in the flesh and the sins of hell
i am belial
i bend my knees not before my selfish desire
laugh at the tragedies
mock with disrespect
goats under rule of father time
leaches pass judgement on their fellow kind
and die when their inner self goes astray
alas, i pay homage to the ancient ones
speak my name!
raise the staff of the morbid priest
descend into the fires of the true law
suffocating evil smoke arise
cleansing the masses in iniquity
cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
vile crematory burns my eyes
mortals filled with despair
they quest to foresee their fate
caverns below await the wine to flow
rape the harvest of souls
i watch in awe as the crucifiers march
killing time, killing all i see
another moon rise, human waste
screaming: "why hath thou forsaken me?"
suffocating evil smoke arise
cleansing the masses in iniquity
cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
vile crematory burns my eyes
it's the dawn of the crucifiers
suffocation
it's the dawn of the crucifiers
suffocation
suffocating evil smoke arise
cleansing the masses in iniquity
cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
vile crematory burns my eyes
we stand defiant
in this great big ugly world
do believe that the chaos
was our one true calling
first we muscled fate
then we brazenly call disorder
watch the normals cower
they just can't take it anymore
withstand together now
all the damning from on high
fist horns are roaring forth
as i scream into the sky
i'm morbid
morbid and
sordid
distorted
bring them to their knees
i'm morbid
morbid
won't be thwarted
from celebrating morbid victories
we're seen as monsters, merely being...
is a threat to all
what can't destroy us makes us strong
and in a twisted mind
oh everything is possible
and in a twist of fate
we make it all come down...crumbling down
oh we'll bring them down
we stand invincible not just a dream
straight from the underground we scream
i'm morbid...
we stand invincible not just a dream
straight from the underground
the gods are screaming
tear down the obstacles this is our way
we're born to quake the world
there is no other way
i'm morbid...
havohej another me born to serve
to plague and moan
so many years my seed condemned
no free to soar!
will is yours? so creator
no intent could shadow
my disease ... ever lusting pain
world of sickness
blessed are we to taste life of sin
my touch is inhumane
nocturnal beast inside
is void of light
and empty shall remain
world of sickness
blessed are we to taste life of sin
confront me unholy ones
bastard saints scorn of the earth
i summon thee now poison me
death under will burn in my soul
exalt me enemies of the lamb
intrude we are of one
under will, i walk the path of sin
with your spells i die again
raise me from mortal
my will be your will
my words speak your words
your pains raise me to bliss
what of this anger now
received to lance your enemy
i feel the energy
the poison moves in me
i spill blood
come alive, i witness
in rapture i'm born again
come alive, i bear scorn
in rapture i'm reborn
confront me unholy ones
intrude we are of one
under will, i walk the path of sin
with your spells i die again
i am the god of gods
master of the arts
i desecrate the chaste
writhe in the flesh
blasphemy
chant the blasphemy
mockery of the messiah
we curse the holy ghost
enslaver of the weak
god of lies and greed
god of hypocrisy
we laugh at your bastard child
no god shall come before me
blaspheme the ghost
blaspheme the ghost
blaspheme the ghost
blasphemy of the holy ghost
do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
rebel against the church
drink from the chalice of blasphemy
rise up against the enslaver
blasphemy
chant the blasphemy
mockery of the messiah
we curse the holy ghost
enslaver of the weak
god of lies and greed
god of hypocrisy
we laugh at your bastard child
no god shall come before me
blaspheme the ghost
blaspheme the ghost
blaspheme the ghost
blasphemy of the holy ghost
do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
rebel against the church
drink from the chalice of blasphemy
rise up against the enslaver
blasphemy
a call to take your hand
for i'm one with the dark
how dare you come for me
and again you must die
so ancient curse known to me
behold the powers i unleash
upon your throne
know my words, feel my hate descend
lord of light
i will swarm against you now
gods perverse
wickeds at my side
misery
thorns to lance your every word
nazarene
now i crown you king in pain
suffer
dark eyes, shadows grim
they come for me
midnight chimes, blackened earth
the evils rise
pits of hate open wide
chasms of my dreams
last of chimes monks arrive
and take my mind again
waste polluted memories
acid rivers flow
vigil for this land's decay
sounding from below
dogs of war, satan's own
plotting all their sins
weapons aimed at liberty
my vision no one wins
take my mind
all the way
the darkside calls
i shan't resist
men forever rot in pain
mind machines control
toxic rains scouring brains
victimizing souls
winds of war suffocate
voodoo in the sky
breathe the gases, breathe no more
my vision all will die
take my mind
all the way
the darkside calls
i shan't resist
cut myself and release the blood
pains of a thousand years
pathic sights journey's end
descent into another world
my time has come to meet the
masters . . . all the corporate lords
i'm not afraid to face all their
trials slavery in the end they'll
still have no power over me
daylight shines blind my eyes
waken to another day
tribulation now has passed
but the dreams remain
walls of sleep fade away
abandonment of wonders
monks of knowledge bid farewell
and leave me with these visions
from the darkside
visions
from the darkside
no god will claim this garden
too sickening to the eyes to see this
long ignored my words of warning
from the world i built, erased
so it shall know no peace in my time
in absence of my voice for guidance
in the absence of my hand and whip
grew the absence of the knowing
unknowing
grew the absence and grew the festering
a boiling abscess that
was sure to burst with failure
from a distance i have observed
minding my slaves like children
absorbing your petty struggles
disgusted by your petty lives
i have witnessed your sleight of hand
i was betrayed by you many times
i have craved to bring forth my vengeance
i have yearned to dismantle this
world of unfathomed treasures
this garden disgraced by man
your ways despised by beasts and gods alike
all gods agree your ways must end
they have waited long to see this
you claim to not need my guidance
yet you reach for my hand and plead
obsessed with your futile struggles
you are mistaken to think i feel
from a distance i have observed
minding my slaves like children
absorbing your petty strife
disgusted by your petty life
all gods have left this garden
these gods have left in shame
dismissed and long forgotten
this world of useless being
this endless festering
bred from the bowels
sheep one and all
bound by the doctrine of lies
to fucked human shit
i shout blasphemy
as i make my way
thru to the promised land
smell of shit is so foul
writhe in disgust
earth heaves and death comes to call
all the waste cling to your lie
you are as sand and the wind blows
my disgust a fever
to kill a thousand more
gene dead from birth
god's holy fuck
canonized but of no use to me
human shit, untermensch
waste begone from my earth
desolation no life bodies littering
beast of earth devour
cleanse this world for those who deserve
burning cities, all is well
i remain in my conviction
as the waste in sewer flows
thru the promised land
caught within my evil spell
now its time to burn in hell
you were fooled no return
you're just a doll for him to burn
see the reaper in his eyes
messenger prince of flies
brain washed with sin and death
time to burn my evil wrath
evil spells
evil spells
bring the children down to burn
once you fall no return
sin takes you by surprise
on this backwards hellbound ride
gates of hell drawing near
satan loves the taste of fear
quenching all with black desire
burn your souls in furnace fire
evil spells
evil spells
evil spells of the dead
messengers of your death
falling endless in your tomb
locked within infernal doom
see the reaper in my eyes
messenger prince of flies
warlock's voice surrounds your dreams
baking soul within your screams
evil spells
evil spells
churning sea of absu
place of weeping death
tiamat, dark serpent
lord of the morbid priests
enraged with hate for god
the priests of chaos chant
from the book of the worm
they burn the symbols of christ
we spit on the virgin lamb
and mock the words he spoke
his ways not worthy of me
we choose to burn in the pits of hell
wreakers of death and havoc
inflicting never ending pain
sing the words of emptiness
formulas of death
call the queens of hell
and the god of the dead
the sea of absu rolls
rising spirit of nar-marratuk!!!
bow down before the master
and pray the defeat of god dog
prayer of the ensnarers
blind fiends of chaos rule
rise up o powers of the sea
in the name of absu i call
come and carry my curse
to the ones who me disgust
may they burn in my cauldron
for they are as molten wax
so made it be
liars in wait, priests of the night
make images to burn by the moon
robbing the spirit, raping god's law
send up our hate to burn heaven's gate
churning sea of absu
place of weeping death
tiamat, dark serpent
lord of the morbid priests
enraged with hate for god
the priests of chaos chant
from the book of the worm
they burn the symbols of christ
bow down before the master
and pray the defeat of god dog
prayer of the ensnarers
blind fiends of chaos rule
rise up o powers of the sea
in the name of absu i call
come and carry my curse
to the ones who me disgust
may they burn in my cauldron
for they are as molten wax
so made it be
liars in wait, priests of the night
make images to burn by the moon
robbing the spirit, raping god's law
send up our hate to burn heaven's gate
gods transform me
this storm will cleanse me
civilized i shall not be
by this holy strain of laws
i fall below the earth
i smell the ancients' breath
the fiends encircle me
they speak my name in tongues
for i'm no human now
i burn the ways conform
the gods are pleased with me
they speak my name in tongues
i'm the seer
i know the texts divine
thunder words
demons race into my eyes
azazel, lend to me your wings of twelve
i shall fly into the storm
i, son of fire, in anger become
the lightning bolts that strike the earth
i'm the seer
i know the texts divine
thunder words
demons race into my eyes
locked deep beyond the gate
lost within the stars
realm of the ancient ones
malignant ones
against the light
power of the blackened sky
hateful spawn "we are the chasm depths"
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
a scorn from the absu
kutulu snaps his jaws
cauldron burns and receives
crushing the voice of the tyrants
raise the horns in blasphemy
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours

crushing the voice of the tyrants
raise the horns in blasphemy
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
your plastic souls melt within cauldrons burning black
chanting to the ancient ones, chants of broken lines
kneel before the altar, sacrifice is made
it is pleasing to the ones most ancient of the days
they call the prince of disease, messenger of the absu
carry through the icy winds our curse upon their church
hanging helpless above the pentagram
sacrifice swings within leather noose
sing the ancient hymn that makes the absu roll
raise the rusty knife, let loose the blood of kingu
sudden death throws off the balance that's within the sky
priest calls forth infernal names to the ones beyond the gate
angel of disease one who shuns the light
shub niggurath goat with one thousand young
praise the beast, the chanting grew
praise the beast with virgin blood
praise the beast with soul and mind
praise the beast and show the sign
bind their kings in iron chains
execute the judgment for them
come and taste the fleshy pleasures
orgies of endless time
beneath the rolling for hate ignites their eyes
from their graves the dead rise to answer nammtar's call
on a twisted cross the virgin corpse hangs
they blacken out the sun and burn the elder gods
morbid priest calling forth
abominations of the sky
kutulu meets in the void
ancient ones rule once more
beasts awaiting, restless
circus victims panic struck
hunger spawns bestial frenzy
commencement of the feast
by the sign of the cross
whips crack
centurions might be known
christians standing breathless
circus victims panic struck
scream arena butchery
where is their god
as the faithful meet their end?
judgment has passed
who questions this law?
pagan belief of sacrifice
kill them all
kill them all for slander
kill them all and mute their ways
kill them all
kill them all for slander
kill them all and mute their ways
judgment has passed
who questions this law?
pagan belief of sacrifice
evil minds grievious sins
pagan lives have no place for law
twisted worship exhume the dead
minds unite for evil cause
death corrodes the book once strong
evil lourd destroys his foes
plague has spread throughout the land
revelations have begun
call of evil's mastermind
christians flock to the beast
burning crosses burn souls
exterminate the altar of laws
atrocities of a new reich
holy war and holocaust
god weeps and turns his back
the time is right to destroy the world
damnation
fill the world with plague
force of devastation
tyranny from above
damnation
fill the world with plague
force of devastation
tyranny from above
churning cities lust so profane
driving the will to destroy
crippling powers i'm forced to partake
unholy rituals
crimes of a world barely alive
melting debauchery
ashes to ashes, so must i be
lost in this misery
there's nothing left here for me
i know of no other way
even death cannot change my ways
i'm first in the line
to hell we shall go
calls of evils mastermind
christians flock to the beast
burning crosses burn souls
time is right to destroy the world
damnation
fill the world with plague
force of devastation
tyranny from above
gone is the will, gone is the time
the ways of the righteous
again we will never see them
gone is the strength, gone is the courage
to deny these treasures
gone is the way of every king
to no kings have we prayed
to no kings do we bow down
to no prayers do we yield our cleansing
your gods rejoice in your end
hear us sing
of man in eulogy
hear us sing
mocking the gods and their heresy
hear us sing
in glory of how it soon will be
hear us sing
mourning no gods, for they will know defeat
gone is their pride, gone is their hate
gone is every witness
gone is the need to decide
gone is all life, gone is the tumor
that is human being
gone is the need for their gods
with no gods do we feast
from no gods do we cower
no prayer will yield our cleansing
this fate no god would change
hear us sing
hear us sing
with no gods do we feast
from no gods do we cower
no prayer will yield our cleansing
this fate no god would change
i stand before thee, gods of all prestine
come forth to see, all things to be seen
now know the presence, and choose thy wrath
for flock of tyrants, who know not thy path
come now in sweeping vengeance
come now in needed time
i demand as i stand before you
cleanse this worlds decay
i demand to know the light of a promised land
i demand to see this corrosion wiped away
and the slithering begins
as the shell of men crawl weeping
and as the light of dawn is growing
the realization sets in
and with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
that the ways of the shallow empty
have brought it down
the winds that are blowing
shall bring it down
and while your clinging
to the ways of your worthless life
your words is falling
you are left with nothing
and with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
your ways so shallow and empty
have brought it down
your ignorant haze
has brought it down
return these days to the righteous
heal these wounds of time
i have waited so long
for the winds of change to come
through eyes still clear
through eyes not dulled by fear
through eyes behind the soul
i see what must be...
i demand to know the light of a promised land
i demand to see this corruption wiped away
come to me, lord of filth
hear my cries princes of nightmares
touch us with your morbid lips
let us taste your foulness
bleed for the devil
impious mortal lives
feel the enticing power
fill the chasm of your soul
fill the air with the smell of death
grace us with your magick
fill the night with the stench of evil
i summon forth the beast
bleed for the devil
impious mortal lives
feel the enticing power
fill the chasm of your soul
cold look in his eyes
he holds the gleaming knife
girl cries as he cuts away the
strips of flesh
bleed for the devil
impious mortal lives
feel the enticing power
fill the chasm of your soul
eyes to see
ears to hear
darkness swallowing all in its path
the blind leading the blind and the "flock" is ever confused
who has the gift of healthy sight and mind
who can withstand while the others are blown away?
eyes to see
what the others see not
ears to hear
the voice of the elders guides
eyes to see
and the blind; they wither away
you fools! these eyes are never for you
darkness corrupting all in its path
greed leading the man to blindness, suffering
and ever foretold
the meek shall have this earth
alas without sight they will only be left with demise
worlds apart are they and i
my world remains in sight
their lives despair
the "i's" and "they's" cannot compare
how can you defeat that which finds
nourishment in your attack?
how can you kill that which
finds sanctuary in your blade?
how can you hinder that which
embraces the strategies against it?
you can take nothing from not
in my being, nothing is
nothing becomes
nothing is not
in your world, all things return to me
i'm the collector of soul
for they're never past my control
i take of what is and nothing of that i give
i'm the alpha omega
my way in itself, complete
i am the continuum
human, meagerness of purpose
come feed me what i please
my spirit shan't be hindered
for it knows no weakess
i dine on your pain
your strength is only that of men
human, why do you clutch your flesh so?
in my being i am
i will
i create
in your world all things return to me
cold finger on the trigger
behind the line drawn in the sand
anger rise!
we fight a war with much at stake
the rights of birth that no one can take
overflowing with anger
a soon to be awakening
will be martyrs on to glory
dawn finds us in this rage
my finger on the button
with what's so foreign in my sights
anger rise!
we wage a war
our nature to preserve
by any means
our enemies be gone
no longer can we wait
as an enemy drains our future
as the light of a new day shines
our anger fuels our march this dawn
as it must be
this dawn of the mad
call of duty
all the minutemen rise and shine
call of duty
only sovereigns stand the test of time
restless minds beneath the ground
through ghostly winds i hear the sound
crying forth in ancient tongues
eternal quest of vengeance
from tombs of scorn cadavers rise
angered fury in their eyes
solemn rage, a need to kill
feasting on holy hordes
evil curse is carried forth zombies rage
burning holy images in life they were
forced to hail
eternal flames have purified their souls
born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom come
twisted oath nodebliwith
preying on those who seek the cross
let none be pardoned for their crimes
feeble race will die
scripture burns in infamy
tortured souls have been set free
taunting he who sits on high
pray thy kingdom come
evil curse is carried forth zombies rage
burning holy images in life they were
forced to hail
eternal flames have purified their souls
born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom come
banished from the living
bodies long decayed
mass of resurrection
sepulchers abandoned
insurgent souls arise
disseminating evil
curse of devistation
implored by hells command
darkness rips the land
morbid priests serenity
sing praise
thy kingdom is at hand
twisted oath nodebliwith
preying on those who seek the cross
let none be pardoned for their crimes
feeble race will die
scripture burns in infamy
tortured souls have been set free
taunting he who sits on high
pray thy kingdom come
evil curse is carried forth zombies rage
burning holy images in life they were
forced to hail
eternal flames have purified their souls
born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom come
naught within this circle
all but emptiness expelled
i am deep in wicked
and whore to demons works
master i call thee
master surround me
with evil in our hearts
this night we take revenge
mote it be
satan's sword i have become
no son shall escape
no word left unburned
the power is in me
hellspawn in aeturnum
i burn with hate
to rid this world of the nazarene
this night of splendor
the beast arise in me
this is my destiny
my sword shall take life
release this fury
malediction
cursed existence
writhing in this life of dissent
pain for pleasure
pain for adoration
pain is to godliness
bleeding for ecstasy
divine
pain divine
locked in vicious
offer to the sado-gods
nails driven through my dreams
bleeding pain is a god's reward
gliding through these dungeons
heightened senses overwhelmed
hedonistic rupture
endurance makes one divine
divine
pain divine
locked in vicious
offer to the sado-gods
nails driven through my dreams
bleeding pain is a god's reward
bring before me anyone who opposes my name
bring before me any voice that speaks in disdain of me
bring before me any force that would challenge my will
bring before me every vessel that is filled with doubt
erase them from my kingdom
we have no way to feed them
burn down every home that keeps them safe at night
rape them as you wish their daughters
feed the wolves their mothers, erase them
make sure that every father sees his son die, before he bleeds
erase them and let the kingdom see it
erase them
take the gold and burn the rest
torture any fool that does not submit
erase them
have them swear devotion, then cut out their tongue
torture any fool that does not submit
make them believe in this
secured limitations
you created this thing you call sin
a guide for the undisciplined sheep
through the pain and denial the pleasure reaped
a freedom contained within a shell
and all that's without you call hell
you scorn our existence
unclean despising our ways
shall the unclean come and infect you
for our ways, disheveling your hold
and the random perplexing the fled
behind the walls of concrete, they hide
secured limitations
from uncertainties the god-mind knows
and from the nothingness, all the wines flow
the affluence, the-mother's gift
but you can't, through the concrete
you scorn our existence
unclean despising our ways
shall the unclean come and inflect you
for the heathens have chosen a different light
and the vision of the all through the inner sight
for the freedoms and prisons are in the mind
secured limitations
from the uncertainties the god-mind knows
and from the nothingness all the wines flow
the affluence, the god-mother's gift
but you can't see, through the concrete
rise through the gate, iak sakkath
from depths beyond the sky
the realm of evil gods
painful... they eat your mind
evil in disguise
breathe in pain
blackened souls remain
ghouls who pray the death of god
destroy jehovah's church
vomit upon the cross
and burn the book of lies
evil in disguise
breathe in pain
blackened souls remain
ghouls who pray the death of god
destroy jehovah's church
vomit upon the cross
and burn the book of lies
evil in disguise
breathe in pain
blackened souls remain
yog sothoth evil one
come forth and taste the blood
infant entrails
are hung upon the twisted cross
evil in disguise
breathe in pain
blackened souls remain
shards of broken machinery
gears dislodged and flailing
flesh gives steel no challenge
bones cannot withstand
blades will smash resistance
chains will drive the hunting of the flesh
slick through the skin straight to the soul
leaving no breathing man alive
kill them all
knock down their walls, flatten their homes
leaving no place for the humans to hide
kill them all
burn every bridge
scorch every crop in case one survives
kill them all
burn every one
grind their bones to dust
mere flesh cannot withstand us
we have come to wipe this planet clean
to end your consumption
mere flesh cannot withstand me
i've come to wipe this planet clean
to clean to burn to grind
blades will smash resistance
chains will drive the hunting of the flesh
with swipe of hand release disease
exonerate their thoughts of gods
at odds with what they see
with slam of fist to flesh of earth
discharge your breath of
molten poison, scorch their lungs
i am all prophecies fulfilled
yet you refuse too see this
you mock my name, have you forgotten?
i am the truths that were lost, taught
as myths and buried in earth
the soil won't hide the warning signs
my art, to bring demise
my skill, it is necessity
my will, exists through time
it's my rite, to rid this world of life
my presence means demise
i relinquish kings of power
my course to disassemble life
to embellish while you cower
i am proof that all denied, was scripted
for all to know this
thus all who closed their eyes
will pray now to have witnessed this
with abandon, they have tarnished
in ignorance they devour
consumed by the lust of owning all
their slavery, their bliss
they are repulsed by the gifts we have given
they cannot hold them in their hands
these fools have felt unsettled
shall stay and watch it as it burns
i am the architect
it is my design to betroth this earth
you called my name
have you forgotten?
i am the builder of all loss
i am the keeper at all cost
the soil, the air, are my creations
and i shall watch them burn
i am the architect
i am the un existence
you know my name!
you have not forgotten!
i am creator of this world
i am the keeper of the soil
the soil won't hide
the warning signs
i am all prophecies fulfilled
yet you refuse to see this
you mock my name
i have not forgotten!
i am the truths that were lost
taught as myths and buried in earth
the soil, the air, are my creations
weak aside no place for those our struggle
leaves behind
our lord won't tolerate those whom through
attrition fall
we must dominate
with iron through our veins and a will made so elite
hunting for our daily bread and the sinister close in sight
hunger always drives the beast and the women fall prey
leading all the wonders to certain fate
another victim reviled
i'm staring at you through the eyes of the wolf
tell me who is going to save you now!
animal senses ever alert
praise be to the father-war
as a servant i am serving myself and i bathe in anticipation
unless you taste it you could never know
all the power our lord bestows
with a bow and a kiss profane
be a victor or be a victim
to amend any treasons of the truth
or of the soul
we the gods of all things share witness
so be it the law
that any being beneath our skies shall
know our mercy when it is earned
and shall know the wrath of the gods
when it is deserved
now we decide
these feeble yet volatile human beings have menaced
beyond what is acceptable
their yearning to self consume in misery
has made them every bit expendable
their reasoning brings questions of their
understanding, their truth is anything
but logical and i suspect that the facts
will show beyond a doubt, the evidence is clear to see
i share your hatred and i share in your disgust
i second the motion, beyond a doubt, they are expendable to us
release all demons of the underworld, release the wrath of all our kin
unleash the demons beneath the soil, let this cleansing now begin
now come our fury upon this world
now come to bring upon them endless night
resolve this land of these succubi
these humans, this burden
awaken my brothers
of vengeance we rise
to devulge this enemy
to enlighten the ones who sleep
worlds have passed and so too has time
my slumber now disturbed
this place of hate, thy worlds shall burn
humans, i shall feast upon your ignorance
you will destroy yourselves
mortals, your slithering existence
sickens the gods, my brothers
it awoke me, from timeless sleep
my dreams destroyed, my visions lost
and so i watch you pray
and spite your worlds
forgive me father? i am not your god
you crawl to me, and beg to me my sheep
you have fallen, curse your empty lives
blind, like wolves you turn on yourselves
the lines have long been drawn
between the life and death
the right and wrong
but what's the reason
what's our reason?
the walls are high we know
they've gotta come down
'cause we've been crossing the line since 1989
we're moving the world
because our power is a shining
sick groove with fu**ing magic to prove that
the radicals are here to stay!
we're living hardcore and radical
we'll always be maniacal and animal
they fear us cause we're physical irrational
our radi-killer kult is thriving!
setting fire to everything we see
fill the rage inside the music... what will be
given reason then taken away
because the boundaries are coming down...
'cause though we live
and breathe we're like nasty machines
taking out targets and we do it with ease
we've been called
we scream back never the same
and we tear it up as radicals!
we're banging hardcore radical
maniacal and animal
beast stomping with an appetite insatiable
we are the radikult...
we're living hardcore and radical
we'll always be maniacal and animal
they fear us cause we're physical irrational
our radikult is thriving!
bang it hardcore and radical
maniacal and like an animal
beasts stomping with an appetite insatiable
we are the radikult...
our beats down
one step close to the fiery end
just take another dose of our insane world
it all gets better
feel next to nothing 'til we drop it again
radical
radikul
never made to order unpredictable
demoniacal and so fanatical are the
zealots and the martyrs of the radikult
war
kills on the land
blood
saturates
this hallowed ground
to which my fathers fell
rebel souls
buried deep beneath
this hallowed ground
land of my ancestry
drink the blood
rebel lands rise again
war-death lingering
blood rivers flow
in sacrifice
unholy war
implored from below
no peace as
rebel lands rise
quaking below my feet
mortals shall suffer defeat
forgotten evils below
rejoice as the blood flows
sacred night on the eve of may
we gather before the stars
taste the hunger of the fire
vastness of the continuum
heretics of a way unseen
celebrate, the greatest of means
beelzebub, lord of the flies
by your hand the zamanu dies
drink, drink, the blood of the ancients
me-zu me pa-ku-ku-de-hul
(your divine ordering principle is a divine order which manifests itself with
most sweetness)
star encircled with the power-names
we speak in the broken lines
leviathan will open the gate
to the great abyssous planes
feel the icing winds of the ab-zu
sea below all seas
leviathan, serpent of truth
share with us most perfect way
call to the earth, fortify our will
come air spirits, be our eyes this night
primal flames are warmth to our souls
waters of life, great blessings you pour
calling on leviathan
open the gate
link us with the wonder of the abyss planes so great
lord of the rolling thunder
celebrate with us this night
rip away the veil
hear our praise
your slumber is our paradise
you smite our enemies down
for we, the few enlightened
through your will we break our bonds
lord who shatters paradigms
from the rubble the new shall rise
your way presents death for them
the me-gal-gal do we praise
come centaur
those who prance to the hymns of truth
come join us
come leviathan
make passage of the entrance we've
prepared for you this night

(translation:)
lady of splendour, it is thine loving embrace
sweet nectar for which i forever thirst
heavenly lady, i hunger
it is thine kiss of divinty for which i hunger
kingdoms infamous for taking as they please
to appease a voice of righteousness
infidels and heretics, enemies of our light
shall be dealt with in the name of god
it is the rite of our kind to silence any tongue
that would try to oppose the king of our land
bring us their heads as trophies of our victories
praise us and align as soldiers of a destiny
foretold by ancient prophets
bring us new lands, these people too will praise us
praise our god or meet your own
it matters not to us, we have glory either way
bow down before our king
fear is your new faith, fear is your new doctrine
be docile until we say, be ready with your life
if the king needs you to die
bring us their head as trophies of our victories
praise us and align as soldiers of a destiny
foretold by ancient prophets
bring us new lands, these people too will praise us
the followers of ancient ways shall be taught to follow us
or be beaten to their fate
the kingdom does not accept any praise of other lands
it will be treated as an act of war
you exist because we allow it, so kneel to show your god
it is us that you fear
prepare to learn the ways of this new kingdom
prepare to swear your soul and life to keep it
prepare to give yourself to do our bidding
prepare to sacrifice for our desire
omniscient are the eyes that see beyond
what we choose to see
transcending of beliefs, that limit man's being
the dogma that feeds the listless
has thrived uncounted years
impeding on ones perception
of what is to be
awaken to see
a god of a desertion
a god of lies
enlightened by a way, deceiving
only truth to the blind
the salvation that you seek is empty
no god of light
the venom that has fed your faith
you except with ease
but the sights that lay before you
destroy your beliefs
awaken to be
at one with nothing
now all will be seen
the seeds of the weak destroy
the lies told of forgiving, exposed
the ignorant, thrown to the wake
your calling names of gods
they are only shrines
the waves of the truth, enslave
slaying the blind
awaken to a light of knowing
all your truth was lies
and the faith which you embraced
has left you blind
deceived like the fools that surround you
it came with ease unfulfilled were the days of your being
but now you will see
death to my vision
blind i shall serve
give rise to god war
watch the civils fall
hateful seed inside me
scald my mind of all but truth
i concede; i am the chosen one
open wide the gate
stain the world with the blood of man
affliction
forced unto all
human vexation
transcend with blood on my hands
spirits of the grave remember
rise up o' powers from the land of til
plague and madness spread thru this world
burn in me for i suffer your will
bil ur-sag
you quake the earth
scorcher of skies
your towers of flames
you've come to cleanse the treacherous act
you've come to tame the rebeliousness
bil ur-sag lul-lu nig-hul tur

you glide across and beneath the lands
your affects engulf the rebeliousness

terror
your battle roar seeds
terror
no shield can withstand
the seven weapons of flame
the principal force that you wield
captive
the hostile ones are held
captive
the insubmissive are
brought to their knees
for they cannot counter
your massive assault upon them
the ill-natured
you've burned from our land
hostile gatherings you've tamed
you were unmatched
no counter could be found
with fury and flames
you scorched their aggressiveness
bil ur-sag lul-lu nig-hul tur

(translation:)
* bil ur-sag lul-lu nig-hul tur ha-elm zalag *
o lion-head, your awesome blaze of fire consumed the gathering of the
treacherous and the ill-natured. purifying them
* za-a-kam me-lam-ma-bi-du ki-bal-a su-sa *
it is thine aura, awful lights, overwhelming the enemy lands
* ur-sag zi-ga-ni naphar ajjabi sharush *
o lion-heads, with your most awesome rising power
destroyer of the gathering of the enemy gods
* sa-par-mah-zu diri la-magiru sin su-la *
your great net, being so enourmous swallowed the disobedient ones, binding
there hands
breathless i stand free
blind to fates which fall to men
embracing the chilling winds, still i am
the mist freeze falls from my breath
steel gray skies encompass my sight
caring not for other worlds
(and there are other worlds than these)
your fathers tried to slay me
your brothers fell before me
clashing, as hates collide
through echoed cried i wade
upon frozen ground, my victims lay
pounding the frozen earth
the hooves of horses carrying men
swords raised high
the rush of war flowing through their veins
the warm blood soon to meet the earth
from which it came
your fathers tried to slay me
your brothers fell before me
ageless, still i am
heathens, they bring their crusades to me
failing, they've come to die in vain
nameless, their meaningfulness is none
i summon the strength of the gods
and we are one
hear this, see this, know this
for this is the ways that it must be
for solace i eat the heart
to steal the power, this magic holds
and to taste the bitter vengeance
that within me has dwelled
men of kings have come to end me
only to die in vain
legends, have cursed my name
spells are spoken
believed to ward me away
your fathers tried to slay me
your brothers fell before me
ageless, still i am
just close your eyes
can you remember?
the generations not so long ago
i feel the shameless urge that we must restore
our former king to his rightful throne
and with me lords and maidens
we wait for the chosen son's return
i come alive
it's a time for celebration
our will to restore
make our past become the future once more
still he lives! 2000 years have passed
and still we're yearning for his return
we fulfill a wishful prophecy
and so the chanting begins:
hail caesar, hail caesar, we render unto you
what is still yours
share the wish as it must be
our king and palace
mode it be
gods enslaved, traitors burning
might and splendor forever return
spawn of the ever rolling abyss
ever espousing unluminous
charred soul burned at rebirth
quest not save the death of the sun
repulsed by the light
heart pumping ice
so cold to this world
reclude until the summoning
sworn to the black
our father begotten, not made
before all legends of man
receive my loyalty, my offering
in my veins; the blood of the ancient brood
summon me
burning inside, i feel the call
blood of the ancient ones now boils
at war war with the race
father rise and the world be one
repulsed by the light
no feeling for life
drained of my being
i lie dead but still i'm sworn
before that which is, all was not
less the sweet waters of habsu
chthhulhu amah-ushumgal-anna
triumvirate of most high
spirits of the deep waters, remember
humbaba, lord of the forest, remember
from the sweet bitter all that is came
creation of man and their gods
but man, fashioning overwhelm
could not see the light which he holds
spirits of purifying flames, remember
anunna, gods of the skies, remember
anunnaki, judges of ur, remember
anunnaki, weighers of the truth, be praised
the gift of flesh
was in fact life's curse
although born one in the same
in spirit, but the flesh all too coarse
discord, among the gods of men
although they were brothers
diversities grew
overshadowing their connection
on the clearest of days they are
one in the same
pettiest of purpose
degenerates things to their crudest form
being loathsome to habsu
zi-zi badur-ku-ku, kanpa
warring, in the belly of tiamat
brothers do battle
principalities of folly
disturb the mummu
the one who bore all was
appalled by their ways
her dream time was of no peace
their fleshly behavior
overbeating and proud
she despised them
zi zi anunnaki, kanpa
the ways of the underworld are perfect
not to be questioned by that of the brute
clearly beyond the understanding
of that which is ruled by the drives of the flesh
for whom shall then oppose
the lights of asag, purifying flames
come child, the anunnaki wait
truth is the weapon no pity it holds
the ways of the flesh
barbaric behavior patterns
flesh over spirit, the motivator of the worthless
the ways of the flesh
the evolution is minimal
i watch as your kingdoms rise and fall
causing no effective change
your military
command structure of impotence
a gross misuse of force
by leaders who lack in vision
your gods
evidence of your weakness
your focus is one with delusion
you worship that which means your end
rise up, o mahummuhu
the judgement is passed
the treachery is clear
they shalt become empty like the wind
the emptiest of shells so shall they be
o great mother
the armies shall rise with weapons
no pity they hold
from your great mummu
the serpents shall come
venom for blood
and the glory of gods
spirits of the flames, remember
anunna, gods of the skies, remember
anunnaki, judges of ur, remember
anunnaki, weighers of the truth, be praised
mahummuhu gal-gal
me-gal-gal-zu ga hul
amah-ushumgal-anna
me-gal-gal-zu ga hul
our darkest days have come
barbaric rules, self-serving
abandoned hope of gods
dismissed and long forgotten
our fate cannot be seen
prophetic fools have failed us
their visions long dispelled
they've fallen, like all idols
we demand a victor's feast
we demand that all shall know thee
we demand your end be praised
destroy all statues standing
built before you reign
tear them down in your name
disregard all existence
all kings before your time
they shall all be erased
you claim to desire peace
but if the truth be seen
you know us as your enemy
the ones that praise your grace
the fools that claim your glory
will watch the pillars fall
and see your kingdom burn
you called us impure heathens
you mocked our culture's ways
you forced disbelief upon us
by way of sword and blade
you ruled with hand of fury
you pillaged and you raped
none shall sing your praise
they claimed you as their savior
embraced your heinous ways
you proved yourself a failure
you swore to be the shelter
to shield is from the storm
yet, you brought this reign upon us
a shattered ego fallen
dismissed and soon forgotten
your name will be erased
we always were your enemy
and if the truth be seen
we brought your end of days
praise no man as savior
panic.......
this is your one warning...
pounding, pounding... you feel it
burning, burning this lave
scorching weakened hearts be troubled
they scream we're too extreme
we come to spread our insane
this doctrine chaos chaos
demanding nothing less but to
make you scream we're too extreme
tu corazón latiendo
te sientes el dolor
deseo la locura
tu gritas... extreme!!!
welcome to your new religion
we come collecting souls
you come to sing our praises
together selfless
we are your new religion
no religion
extreme!!

visión sufrirá
orejas derretirá
bese su nueva creencia

we are your new religion
no religion
you come to us in torment
and we make your bodies heave
our sounds invoke your demon
together too extreme!
these chains that have choked existence
have fallen away
this veil that has blinded eyes has been lifted
and now it is gone
and like the ways of the sheep
the flock has been to only receive
led to the gates of their enemy
led to the slaughter of their beliefs
and now their gazing eyes have turned
turned to see us laughing
these fools who have thought
us to be as they are
have never truly seen
guided by limiting the ways that they think
they thought us blind and obscene
but now the sheep are wailing
cries to a god they never see
and as the gates are closing
down upon the all they have believed
and now their pleading eyes have turned
turned to see the eyes of the laughing
the ties have bound these fools
to the ways of the blind
is ignorant bliss
lies that were fed to the slumbering mass
they've grazed upon it
and all that awaits men failing to see
is the sight they've despised
the gates have opened
your religion has died
our patience gone for your folly
there'll be no restraint
though it's been urged there's no warrant
to let you remain
ten thousand years
for a test you failed miserably
the target's locked
and this planet will soon be human free
march, march
... no hero should rise amongst you
... don't prolong your misery accept your fate
laser vision has monitored for centuries
we've gathered evidence
we know that you are disease
it matters not...
what counter measures you employ
you're not the first ones that we've destroyed
we take charge the task at hand
rid the third planet of life...
destroy man
we're marching
destructos marching on man
we're marching
destructos marching on!
we're marching
destructos marching on!
convoke the data
attack imminent
final closure on this failed earth experiment
it matters not...
what counter measures you employ
you're not the first ones that we've destroyed
we take charge the task at hand
rid the third planet of life...
destroy man
we're marching
destructos marching on man
we're marching
destructos marching on man
we're marching
destructos marching on man
we're marching
destructos marching on!
destroy man
we're marching
destructos marching on!
we destructos march
no mercy from annihilation
no mercy from destructo-nation
seek total annihilation
no mercy from destructo-nation
we're marching on
through the sordid human remains
the dead attest... your resistance in vain
ten thousand years and you never evolve?
it's over soon for humans one and all
the facts have shown all resources you waste
our eyes have seen all your greed and distaste
you feeble beings, just a blight to this earth
destructos marching on...
hatework
bringer of doom
hatework
what i have in store
what has the devil got to do with it
i'm brewing my toil
so the brimstone comes this way
nightwork
my life's work
nightwork
world in flames
this calls for fire
this is a call for ruin
we will be departed
leave the rot so lonely
hatework
bringer of doom
hatework
and the turmoil comes
hatework
my work
hatework
and the earth's left burning
i call death
death is answering me
my sour images dispelling all doubt
one sip of poison and my darkness comes out
like glass reflecting all the venom i see
my spirit taken task and now i will forever be
vulgore of the gory
vulgore for the glory glory
vulgore tells the ugly story
vulgore existo vulgoré
all the worldly deeds of malice displayed
from a wicked recipe this potion is made
each drop of future's bleak and calloused in view
sick clerics unprepared for vulgore i spew
i rejoice in awful ways
i sickly tune the worst of days
to have unreason's show to tell
all the world is a victim 'cause i'm rainsing hell
go gore the race is on to find a pure one
with simple subjects
oh this never could be fun
gore spreads a santo duelo como nino
feliz un día cuando gore golpea
hypocritical guidance has confused the masses
veiling the instinctive nature of a higher cause
accumulation and consuption
evaluated by your possessions
unabated cleansing of a deeper being
dissociative dissent, liberation through ignorance
disseminate devolution, dissipation of disruption
isolation and dejection, disenchanted exhilaration
discomposed reverence, subservient
constant denial of truth
constant distrust
constant obedience
this has spawned a new type of human
who live in fear and addiction
lead them
guide them to extinction
blessed be the one
the most ancient one
blessed be the one
who was here before and after remain
blessed be the meekness of the flesh
i watch as it withers and dies
come with storm
and blow the flesh from this earth
come with flood
and wash away the flesh from this earth
the mighty of this world
with the mighty of the flesh
but that of flesh
is crushed by that of the mountain
for it is written that
the future of flesh is dust
you are but a shell
your wine something unseen
come with fire
and burn the flesh of the earth
make the earth upheaval
may it swallow up the flesh of this earth
your dreams
mundane delusions of malkuth
my dreams
the continuum force that devours all things
dreams
that eat the flesh and drink the blood
uruku, my brothers
it is your time to feed
your will
empty promises you can't fulfill
my will
brings avalanches of abundance
power
of the gods circulate within my veins
i lie in wait, wait
being that erodes all things
blessed be the ones
the most ancient ones
blessed be the one
who was here before and after remain
blessed be the meekness of the flesh
i watch as it withers and dies
come with storm
and blow the flesh from this earth
come with flood
and wash away the flesh
come with fire
and burn the flesh of this earth
make the earth upheaval
may it swallow up the flesh of this earth
consequence
now the panic comes
you've dabbled in magic, your fingers are burned
lost as you run towards the light
and deep in your heart you have nothing but fear
your future is hanging by a strand
your master makes his just demands
game of life's price coming due
a swell of fear erupts in you
your time is now!
never a prayer, just silence rings
charity works won't change a thing
your balance of life is on our side
there's never a place to hide
what's so real is plain in sight
cost to play: eternal life
for when we play we play for keeps
satan's marks forever we speak
your time is now!
with screams you defy still silence rings
prayers to some god won't change a thing
gleam in your eyes reduced to tears
and deep in your heart you've nothing but fear
why object to "rewards" you know you've earned them
why reject all your fantasy
you can't betray what your works have bargained for you
no use to fear what you have in store
consequence
now the panic comes
you've dabbled in magic, your fingers are burned
lost as you run towards the light
and deep in your heart you have nothing but fear
what's so real is plain in sight
cost to play: eternal life
for when we play we play for keeps
satan's marks forever we speak
your time is now!
with screams you defy still silence rings
prayers to some god won't change a thing
gleam in your eyes reduced to tears
and deep in your heart you've nothing but fear
come burning
are you going to burn with me?
won't you come burning?
the world is watching
all the king's men riding hard
all their horses foaming
and if they were to catch us we'd be set ablaze
burn!
won't you come burning
all the dissident ones
come and walk the line and you will burn with me
witches yes, slaves never
and still i speak
a heretic amongst you
don't you let me live too long
burn!
could you imagine the pain
why would my country men let me down
they're bearing witness just to save their skin
that this might keep them from burning
they'd sell their mothers just to save their skin
that this might keep them alive
the marks i'm bearing are oh so deep
my will ingrained at birth
to flood true darkness with light and reverse
you'll see my covenant to keep
your judgment in the hands of the most inept
condemn those similar to burn with me
but the night is still young
i'm also feeling very bold
i think i'll do some burning of my own
oh the lines are getting longer
more are added everyday
and there seems to be no shortage
of humans for my foul play
no understanding
and no ability to see the signs
they just keep breeding out of order
and adding to the lines more and more
here they go
10 more dead
and the bodies piling higher, higher
10 more dead
and the stench grows stronger
with many more to go
most see me pure evil
but they respect me just the same
when nature's done sustaining
she calls me in to play the cold game
no favors
and no quarter ever shown
for the sheer masses of the masses
still t-s growing
more and more here they go
10 more dead
oh... come ye one come you all are waiting now
line up face the light
oh... and thousands more behind to follow
clueless
will be embers burning bright
oh they're dying for me quickly now
the ways are always mine to choose
'cause once it's done it doesn't matter
between the faith or fate i'm not confused
about my purpose no
reduce them all in shame
and the bones will pave my kingdom
they have only themselves to blame
here they go
10 more dead
why should we serve that which betrays
leeches, they steal of our lives
why should we lower ourselves to the beasts
submissive they are to be made
we need not to be held in their chains
illusions but they can still hold
we rise within the strength
the one who lays them to waste
praising the weapon that cleanses our land
so perfect it's way unopposed
punisher of the treacherous ones
u-mu la mah-ri
this force no bolt withstands
for it's now the merciless one
un-quenchable rage in holds
only sated when the last falls
their deeds of treason
unsees by the ones enchained
ignorance which shielded the crimes
all seen by the all knowing one
you'll perish within the hands
of the storm that means your end
these things you call your gods
these things, they save you not
oh now you live the torment
bound in the chains that enslaved us
now you feel the suffering
that you bestowed upon your being
live the pain of the gnashing teeth that's
grinding your bones enslaver
by what right did you bind us
now you'll reap the suffering
oh there's no mercy for you've
broken the sacred laws you've
taken the dreams of many
lives you have bound and punished
for your crimes no repentance
can turn back the wrath
which you've called on yourselves
by your deeds
no new life can arise
from a land once denounced
by my lord
for unrivaled he stands
for no man may rise up
to enslave any other
made free by design of our god
that of might shall
define what is right
for unmatched is the power
of chthhulhu most high
praising the weapon that cleanses our land
so perfect it's way unopposed
these things you praise as gods
these things, dispirited things
we assemble as those who were before
of the principal force and form
the lighting flash they are
they breathe the word and it becomes
we make the covenant
to the primal source of which we've come
we lift ourselves
on the path that brings us to our dream
the continuum force we praise
your slumber being our highest goal
we make your way our laws
for your me we do decide
amah-ushumgal-anna
deep within you hold the key
habsu being the way
to claim the throne that's ours by right
zamanu muh lal-li zi-pa-gurud-zuneme-e
igi-nu-du-a-hul igi-se-zid-gin
their treacherous decisions have committed them to
eternal dis and torment
for now their only shield
is the ignorance in which they hide
in the shadows of their fears
they feel the gnashing teeth and weeping
(translation:)
* zamanu muh lal-li zi-pa-gurud-zuneme-e *
hostile ones, you soon shall reap the reward you have earned
* igi-nu do-a-hul igi-se-zid-gin *
enjoy now this ignorant bliss in which you live
for the awakening soon shall come
decide, between the ways of the weak
the sheep, to live a lie
or to come to life, in victory we stand
above the meek
to raise the chalice and toast the conquering
to feast upon the spoils that we claim
we are wakening
we are the one you seek
we are the merciless
we are the all is truth
we await, the coming of days
the awakening of the eyes that sleep
the dawn of light for those of us who see
to stand above the shattered flock and their lies
for now it is our time
we are the conquering
we are the one you seek
we are the merciless
we are the all that is truth
victors...now hear me
brothers...as it must be
in victory we stand
our wake, our secret is broken
our legions now are one
the time of the silence now ended
in victory we stand
we are the conquering
the clearing out, the storm
born to be master of the world
fear my ever-pounding words
i desecrate, desecrate false idols heed my way
i'm graced with understanding
my gifts are awe demanding
collecting all the souls once lead astray
my will uncompromising
false gods are realizing
the bitter end of their lies now fades away
nevermore...
nevermore... my bastions oh so foul
we scream for more...
nevermore, nevermore!
long slumbering powers awaken
there will be no mistaking
i beacon all my rouges to taste the might
crush all the subjugates
dark will so concentrated
i'm scattering all the pieces
of their twisted fucking world
never again to see the light of day
nevermore...
it's time to prey we'll seize the day
i wear the scars from the path this way
my mind is something beyond the real
re-sculpt the throne
where my world will kneel
i'm the master of the world
none defy my pounding words
i desecrate, desecrate
false idols blown away
nevermore...
nevermore...
take the reigns with all my will and
scream for more
nevermore evermore!
empires and nations fall, caesars were men not gods
idols change as needed through time
generals are irrelevant without war
kings mean nothing without fools
to master
to feed their manic ego
to win their lusted plights
to follow with no caution
to follow to demise
mad men are praised and worshipped
enslavers victimize
torture, always their answer
to teach incessant hatred
the hand of god became filled with riches for only kings
the hand of kings became the will of men enslaved
depredate, restraint is not an option
this world has fallen, now scorched and barren
the rage of lunatics shall lead us nevermore
the hand, long forgotten, shall feed the blessed now
arise our ancient golom (defeat this enemy)
god strength upon the (the leach infested)
rise our ancients wisdom (bring your pestilence)
rectify, with haste your wrath awakened
malfeasance, you scorn this world
enshrined by grace, your shadows blinds the feeble
disentail the noble few
arise our ancient golom defeat this enemy
god strength upon the leach infested
rise our ancients wisdom destroy this wasteland
enshrined by grace devour this presceance
light the flame of redemption
ghouls attack the church
crush the holy priest
turning the cross towards hell
writhe in satan's flames
crush the priest
the feeble church
dead your god is dead
fools your god is dead
useless prayers of lies
behold satan's rise
crush the priest
the feeble church
the family of dog
lust upon my altar
demons attack with hate
satan in the fires of hell awaits
death against you all
god hear my death call
savagery as judgment days arrive
long we have waited for this time
how many brothers fallen?
how many kept alive as slaves for the wicked few?
'tis time for reparations
'tis time to settle scores
this time we give no warning
this means war!
savagery 'tis now our spirit overflows
war our minds are focused; we are one!
hear now the winds of change
a force to obviate
all the enemies naked now
all the smoke gone and all their mirrors are broken
lost empires crumble; destiny
behold! i crusader no retreat
years of complacency on the part of the mob
feeding on lies
so slothed, so full this is it
restless
and tolerance nearing its peak
woe to the next ones who push us to far
our love is now replaced by war
live cannot be spared, our victory at hand
and by my hand i slay the first
and the last will follow as we watch these wickeds bleed
no rest for the soldiers 'till the purge is done
no salvation until we drench this earth
i am the god of gods
master of the art
i desecrate the chaste
writhe in the flesh
blasphemy
chant the blasphemy
mockery of the messiah
we curse the holy ghost
enslaver of the weak
god of lies and greed
god of hypocrisy
we laugh at your bastard child
no god shall come before me
blaspheme the ghost
blasphemy of the holy ghost
do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
rebel against the church
drink from the chalice of blasphemy
rise up against the enslaver
one spills his blood for horror
choice alone to suffer
infernal voices calling
catastrophe no waiting
10 more encircled wailing
it's his existence glowing
blades for baal
demanding sharp and glistering slice
he can't fail
join them is the one device
we spill and poison ground
below the father's calling
his light will be unbound
once fallen angel spreads his wings
blades for baal...
two down on grounds unhallowed
with 9 more soon to follow
with reaches all but shallow...
purest of all intent
their candles burn both ends
their juices wind and rain... insane
blades for baal
demanding sharp and glistering slice
he can't fail
join them is the one device
blades for baal
all around me shining bright
life-trade for this
death to bring eternal night
blades for baal
... in the readings never found
of ways to keep this evil down
time unmasks the deepest seal
for all the cursed who choose to reveal
darkness takes another chance
luring to the ritual dance
collect the fallen necromance
and decidedly gathering all
give welcome torment
welcome blessing's fall
no crime just reason
just an end to all
mine is the one true baal
curse him no avail
he eats and drinks and burns you hail
so be the sacrifice
you really have no choice
our lives his only vice
give to him his drink then burn
blades for baal
blades for baal
blades for baal
i've seen visions awakening
drawing timeless life to an end
i've felt forces pulling me
and i have rejoiced in them
i've heard voices calling names
i have reveled in their beckoning
for the voices that summon me
have grown immense
my senses keen with desire and pain
senses heightened by my need to see
to feed the hunger that i feel inside
awake my soul to ecstasy
my father the forsaken
the king of blasphemy
they cower at your name
they live in ignorance
they hide behind a doctrine
that has taught them only lies
now let them see
thy world, immaculate
i've seen visions awakening
drawing timeless life to an end
i've felt forces pulling me
and i have rejoiced in them
i've heard voices calling my name
i have waited for their beckoning
for the voices that summon me
bring the gift of bliss
instrumental
locked deep beyond the gate
lost within the stars
realm of ancient ones
malignant ones
against the light
power of the blackened sky
hateful spawn
"we are the chasm depths"
come forth ancient ones, tiamat kutulu
rise, greed the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
a scorn from the absu
kutulu snaps his jaws
cauldron burns and receives
crushing the voice of the tyrants
raise the horns in blasphemy

being has overwhelmed the space between the silence of eternity
vision has intruded upon the light that pours through me, my energy
substance has veiled, the pleasures long lost, the beauty of emptiness
this very flesh confines, and spoils this demon's seed
waiting to light, a dead sky aflame
to suffocate, to rejoice in your misery
this waiting it seems, for so long i've yearned to see
the burning flesh of your humanity
your withering flesh, i've longed to see
may you fall to never again arise
may you cease to ever again be
may your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
pleading, churning, drowning
pleading, dying, burning
the treachery returns to the betraying eyes
your betrayers cries, fall to unyielding ears
and oh how it came to be, that you would pray to me
that you would beg to me, that this curse not come to be
that you would plead. that this curse not be released
may you fall to never again arise
may you cease to ever again be
may your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
pleading, churning, drowning
pleading, dying, burning
you give praise to the statues of gods
dispirited, they hear you not
you give offering to metal and stone
dispirited, how can they respond?
the faith disheveled
temples disdained
you praise the mere shadows of gods
the word, discolored and vain
and the gods, they know you not
they come when the spirit speaks
but your words disdainful
words spawned by the cultureless beings
disclaimed by the once attentive gods
disarmed, the power words are empty
your way being left to the winds
bitter is the wailing of the sheep
even now the memories are dis
barren, the temple's reason was loss
in vulgarian was it swallowed
the mundane, so disbanded they are
not of purpose can they find
the great mother, as if a criminal
disaffiliated from one's people
unwelcome like the rival of a culture
removed, unwelcome she stands
disarrayment of the values' core seeds discord
for now fulfillment cannot be formed
and the sheepfold mourn
in the forge of our will we manifest ourselves
empowering our world
yet the fables of a failed faith
show the effects of this spiritual dis
empty, the gods disavow you
understanding you have lost
for what fulfillment can you possibly hold
in the end of such means
caught in the chains you do not know
you hold the key to the truth
but these chains they dull you mind
shackled by the falsifiers
they share with you only the shadows of things
you commit to serve the mundane
society's slave but you can not see
the spirit so laden in the net of thorns
entrapped by the other's spells
i speak, but you're ignorant to me
can you not see what you hold
they respond to the potent will
of the most high standing
and being unchained by decision
assemblage of the ancient way
with incantations, manifesting our will
expanding our being
you're ripe for ensnare
your dreams and longings are beyond compare
call on me willing child
trade me your life for one without care
show me the wounds
exciting me now the closer you get
miss nothing your world so full of despair
you will never regret
i am all you will know
and it's deeper we go
gift me your soul... please me
deeper and deeper oh beauty meet your beast
bloody notes slurred
dreaming what's human becomes but a blur
oh beautiful child
come to me moist i'm the great connoisseur
woman you play this dangerous way
unknown, unalarmed
to majesty kneel
my allure makes you feel
your wounds are your charm
i am all you will know
and it's deeper we go
gift me your soul
and it's deeper and deeper we go
feel my embrace
and the deeper we flow
... and the beauty will grow
she falls deeper and deeper and deeper
... 'til beauty knows beast...
all the while your pleasure is here
no need to fear
don't look back
your pleasure is here
in my hands cavalier...
i am all that you know
and it's deeper we go
gift me your soul
and it's deeper and deeper we go
my embrace
found your beauty that grows
you're with me now
beauty i'm your beast
you are the one, the oldest one
you come before the legends of men
you come before the legends of gods
you are the sea, creator of all
you're all i need, for you i bleed
plant your seed, earth shall feed
enlighten my soul, spirit grows
born of the fire, i shall return
i am the hellspawn
curse from my eyes, your gods i defy
fulfillment is mine, of the most high
born of the fire, i shall return
answer the call of the oldest one
i am the hellspawn
forever i am, in spirit i am
forever i dream, continual dream
we sleep undisturbed again
chthhulhu we dream in the peace again
i am the hellspawn
travesty the way the wretched stand
upon the earth blind in their ignorance
embracing the slavery of their minds
soulless voids of being left wandering
take this blade of elohim
drain the life from within these fools
release the soul, from within the flesh
saviours your name we celebrate
forlorn, they shutter at their shrines
tortured by deities, they hold no revelance
enslaved by the weakness of their minds
their cripple prayers have left them smothering
seize this, the hand of our god
drain this life the burden of this fools
release the soul, from within the flesh
cleanse the soul, of their lives
cleanse the soul fo impurity
sickness unyielding pestilence
sickness infects of meek
sickness bound to deities
sickness formed by lies
travesty the way the wretched stand
upon the earth blind in their ignorance
embracing the slavery of their minds
soulless voids of being left wandering
[instrumental}
hollow lies fill weakened minds with
hollow dreams
weakened lives fill infamy with failed beliefs
shattered wills fall aimlessly beneath the hollow
hollow words can't fill the void beneath
within they seethe
again they breed
so callous
legends swollen, hallowed waste is stripped away
the venom growing with lust to feed the hollow need
return from ash, returning from a banished world
to savor flesh of the hollow, and all beneath
within they seethe
again they breed
no solace...
so callous...
so seething...
in this they feast
crimen profundis
i will lead the way
divinum formidilosus impetus
i will accept all of the blame
mea culpa, mea mea culpa
black will cover all and smother all
black will never fail to bring terror for all
no traces of illumination sight without light
under cruel reign of shadows
we will only have night
eternal night
illud divinum insane
mea, mea, mea culpa for the terrors brought
we're the monsters caedo caedo
and our sounds are overwrought
grieve right, live in fright, fright
grieve right, live in fright, fright
illud divinum insane
mea, mea, mea culpa
for the terrors brought
we're the monsters caedo caedo
and our sounds are overwrought
mea, mea, mea culpa for insanity
twist the minds of all who hear
our deadly sounds ever mode it be
crimen profundis
i will lead the way
novus lex legis profano
my sickness will lay claim
mea culpa, mea, mea culpa
terror's ease, unease and disease
we make the mass of charlatans
fall down to their knees
they worship but can't follow us
what stars we must be!!!

i am the void of light, silence, i am the dawn of time
i am the all you see, emptiness i am the non

bring the light, to wake our souls
to you we praise and speak your name
absu your strength within us
absu your ways embrace
absu rise in assemblance
absu your will alive
your presence, ornate and breathing
within the serpents crawl
tried, by man as heathens, by courts of a lesser faith
undead, and always dreaming
bathed in worlds unfleshed and clean
awake. silent and watching, through timeless life
raise this being to life
become the same as a god
raise this being to life
become one with the gods
so blessed by thee, chant the names to rise the soul
branded, by this sacred marks, veiled in secrecy
alive, and always dreaming
god of our own divinity
rise, your wait has ended, this time is ours
raise this being to life
become the same as a god
raise this being to life
becoming a god
remnants, from the ash arise the allegiance
martyr's unforgotten lives, immortal
heretics, gods of the dawning time... vindictive
praise this source of strength
seize this time and heed
embrace the strength and heed
the fallen behind me
tyrants, stand before the task, impeding
mortals, in the wake of gods, beneath kings
tyranny, fall away in shards, demise
leaches, clinging to their shite, die blindly
praise this source of strength
seize this time and heed
embrace the strength and heed
the fallen behind me
a way forsaking, waste, unhuman
infected reason, infected being
a new time dawning, our time beginning
the reign of leaches, it now ends...
praise the strength and praise the being
sing these words and dance to victory
praise the force that none can conquer
embrace the strength, the sacred power
praise the strength and the dawn of reckoning
see the wrath fall on those who oppose this
be one in voice and chant the mantra
feel the force and know gods beyond man
praise the strength, and praise the dawning
embrace the wake that flows behind this
grasp the light of the new reign rising
stand with kings, fight undying...
praise the strength, and praise the being
sing these words and dance to victory
praise the force that none can conquer
embrace the strength
remnants, from the ash arise the allegiance
martyr's unforgotten lives, immortal
tyrants, stand before the task, impeding
mortals, in the wake of gods, beneath kings
praise this source of strength
seize this time and heed
embrace the strength and heed
the fallen behind me
lies and you fill their souls
with all oppressions of this world
and all the glory you receive
so, what makes you supreme?
lies and your crown is falling
i offer fantasy
and you, creator
blind with envy
so let the children come to me
their mother loves me, so shall they
woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
man was close behind
just like a snake, i'm slithering
through my world divine
and like the cat i'm stalking
i'll take your soul
and you'll be like me
in emptiness
bow to me faithfully
bow to me splendidly
ninnghizhidda open my eyes
ninnghizhidda hear my cries
plumed serpent of the deep
plumed serpent of the gate
i command come before me
i command bring the key
rise from the depths
see the fire in my wand
ia iak sakkakh iak sakkakth

i call forth the god pazuzu
i call forth the lord of plague
i am of the lost
creatures of spawn of hate
rejoice in the heaving earth

rise spread disease
consume their puny souls

beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
through the ashes of the world consumed
enlightened by their hate
bathing in their lust
bleeding for the taste of revenge
the stricken arise
festering deep inside manipulation
beyond the light, the shadow's fall, this prison's hold
awakened and growing, beyond what eyes can see
tasting the rebirth the crowning of our king
enlightened by their hate
bathing in their lust
bleeding for the taste of revenge
thriving in their hate
writhing in disgust
feasting on their weakness
we rise
the path of blind faith. the path of idolatry
their path of meekness
my wrath of sickness
my wrath of disease
my wraths dismantling
hope of life
beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
through the ashes of the world consumed
enlighten by their hate
bathing in their lust
bleeding for the taste of revenge
thriving in their hate
writhing in disgust
