hello, i've waited here for you
everlong
tonight, i throw myself into
and out of the red
out of her head, she sang
come down, and waste away with me
down with me
slow how you wanted it to be
i'm over my head, out of her head she sang
and i wonder when i sing along with you
if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when
she sang
breathe out, so i can breathe you in
hold you in
and now i know you've always been
and out of your head, out of my head i sang
and i wonder when i sing along with you
if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when
she sang
and i wonder...
if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when
keep you in the dark
you know they all pretend
keep you in the dark
and so it all began
send in your skeletons
sing as their bones go marching in again
they need you buried deep
the secrets that you keep are at the ready
are you ready?
i'm finished making sense
done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
spinning infinity, boy
the wheel is spinning me
it's never ending, never ending
same old story
what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?
what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say that i'll never surrender?
in time or so i'm told
i'm just another soul for sale, oh well
the page is out of print
we are not permanent, we're
temporary, temporary
same old story
what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?
what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?
i'm the voice inside your head
you refuse to hear
i'm the face that you have to face
mirroring your stare
i'm what's left
i'm what's right
i'm the enemy
i'm the hand that'll take you down
bring you to your knees
so who are you?
yeah, who are you?
yeah, who are you?
yeah, who are you?
keep you in the dark
you know they all pretend
what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?
what if i say i'm not like the others?
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
you're the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender?
what if i say i'm not like the others?
(keep you in the dark)
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
(you know they all)
you're the pretender
(pretend)
what if i say i will never surrender?
what if i say i'm not like the others?
(keep you in the dark)
what if i say i'm not just another one of your plays?
(you know they all)
you're the pretender
(pretend)
what if i say i will never surrender?
so who are you?
yeah, who are you?
yeah, who are you?

i've got another confession to make, i'm your fool
everyone's got their chains to break, holdin' you
were you born to resist or be abused?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

the best, the best, the best of you?
are you gone and on to someone new?
i needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose
you gave me something that i didn't have, but had no use
i was too weak to give in, too strong to lose
my heart is under arrest again, but i break loose
my head is giving me life or death, but i can't choose
i swear i'll never give in, i refuse
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
oh, oh oh, oh oh
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
the life, the love you'd die to heal
the hope that starts the broken hearts
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
i've got another confession, my friend, i'm no fool
i'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new
were you born to resist or be abused?
i swear i'll never give in, i refuse

all my life i've been searching for something
something never comes, never leads to nothing
nothing satisfies, but i'm getting close
closer to the prize at the end of the rope
all night long i dream of the day
when it comes around, then it's taken away
leaves me with the feeling that i feel the most
feel it come to life when i see your ghost
come down don't you resist
you've such a delicate wrist
and if i give it a twist
something to hold when i lose my grip
will i find something in there?

another reason to bleed
one by one, hidden up my sleeve
one by one, hidden up my sleeve
hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keeping me down
hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keeping me down
will i find a believer?
another one who believes?
another one to deceive?
over and over, down on my knees
if i get any closer
and if you open up wide
and if you let me inside
on and on, i got nothing to hide
on and on, i got nothing to hide
hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste

a million miles away
your signal in the distance
to whom it may concern
i think i lost my way
gettin' good at startin' over
every time that i return
i'm learnin' to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin?
i'm learnin' to talk again
can't you see i've waited long enough?
where do i begin?
do you remember the days
we built these paper mountains
then sat and watched them burn?
i think i found my place
can't you feel it growin' stronger?
little conquerors
i'm learnin' to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin?
i'm learnin' to talk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin?
now
for the very first time
don't you pay no mind
set me free again
to keep alive a moment at a time
but still inside a whisper to a riot
to sacrifice but knowin' to survive
the first to climb another state of mind
i'm on my knees, i'm prayin' for a sign
forever, whenever, i never want to die
i never want to die, i never want to die
i'm on my knees, i never want to die
i'm dancin' on my grave, i'm runnin' through the fire
forever, whenever, i never want to die
i never want to leave, i never say goodbye
forever, whenever, forever, whenever
i'm learnin' to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
where do i begin?
i'm learnin' to talk again
can't you see i've waited long enough?
where do i begin?
i'm learnin' to walk again
i believe i've waited long enough
i'm learnin' to talk again
can't you see i've waited long enough?
i, i'm a one way motorway
i'm the one that drives away, follows you back home
i, i'm a street light shining

it's times like these you give and give again
it's times like these you learn to love again
it's times like these time and time again
i, i'm a new day rising
i'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
but i, i'm a little divided
do i stay or run away and leave it all behind?
it's times like these you learn to live again
it's times like these you give and give again
it's times like these you learn to love again
it's times like these time and time again

but i've been here before, after all
the witching hour is upon us
you and i can sing haunted songs
in my dreams, i'm climbing ladders
and then i tumble down, rung by rung
and i keep on falling faster
the heart is echoing, on and on, on and on
i feel an earthquake coming on (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i feel the metal in my bones (ah, ah, ah, ah)
'cause i'm a natural disaster (ah, ah, ah, ah)
you're the morning after all my storms (ah, ah, ah, ah)
you're my sea of poison flowers
standing in the sun, row by row
i've been drinking dirty water
the taste of sweet revenge, best served cold, all we know
i feel an earthquake coming on (ah, ah, ah, ah)
i feel the metal in my bones (ah, ah, ah, ah)

i'm cold as a match, ready to strike
so here i go
here lies a city on fire
singing along, the arsonist choir
now here i go
it started with a spark
and burned into the dark
now, here i go
there is a river i found
into the wild, under the ground
so here i go
a button on a string
and i heard everything
now, here i go, well
oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
you have no choice you have to choose
bid farewell to yesterday
say goodbye i'm on my way
but in the end we all
come from what's come before
so here i go, well
oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
you had no choice you had to choose
bid farewell to yesterday
say goodbye i'm on my way
i threw it all away because
i had to be what never was
been so hungry i could lie
you took my word, i took your wine
and held you in my bloody hands
these rattled bones and rubber bands
washed them in the muddy water
looking for a dime and found a quarter
but you can't make me change my name
you'll never make me change my name
pay no mind, now ain't that's something
fuck it all, i came from nothing
i'm something from nothing
you are my fuse
i'm something from nothing
you are my fuse

you'll never make me change my name
pay no mind, now wait that's something
fuck it all, i came from nothing
i'm something from nothing
i'm something from nothing
i thought i knew all it took to bother you
every word i said was true and that you'll see
how could it be i'm the only one who sees
your rehearsed insanity? yeah
i still refused all the methods you abused
it's alright if you're confused, let me be
i've been around all the pawns you've gagged and bound
they'll come back and knock you down and i'll be free
i've taken all and i've endured
one day it all will fade, i'm sure
i don't owe you anything
i don't owe you anything
i don't owe you anything
i don't owe you anything
i had no hand in your ever desperate plan
it returns and when it lands, words are due
i should've known we were better off alone
i looked in and i was shown, you were too
i've taken all and i've endured
one day it all will fade, i'm sure
i don't owe you anything
i don't owe you anything
i don't owe you anything

you wanna tell me a secret
you think i'm gonna find out

it's right down the drain i go
don't leave me drowning in your sunday rain
it's always a shame, oh no
are you a little afraid?
a little alone?

you can sing along with me
i don't wanna be queen
just trying to keep my t-shirt clean
there's one thing that i have learned
if it gets much better, it's going to get worse
and you get what you deserve
and you get what you deserve
everybody needs, everybody needs
needs a little suffer
i just wanna do, i just wanna do
do a little number
bite the hand that feeds, bite the hand that feeds
bite a little harder
what's it gonna take, what's it gonna take
gonna take a lover?
hop on the train to nowhere, baby
don't you wanna hitch a ride?
lights go out and your head starts spinnin'
someone got you hypnotized
down on the chain, your bad tuxedo
brother, can you spare a dime?
count what's left when it's all gone wrong
how you gonna make it right?
how you gonna make it right?
everybody breathe, everybody breathe
breathe a little deeper

one, two, three, four
i know what you're thinking
we were going down
i can feel the sinking
but then i came around
and everyone i've loved before
flashed before my eyes
and nothing mattered anymore
i looked into the sky
well i wanted something better man
i wished for something new
and i wanted something beautiful
and wish for something true
been looking for a reason man
something to lose
when the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)
when the wheels touch ground (when the wheels touch ground)
and you feel like it's all over
there's another round for you
when the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)
know your head is spinning
broken hearts will mend
this is our beginning
coming to an end
well you wanted something better man
you wished for something new
well you wanted something beautiful
you wished for something true
been looking for a reason man
something to lose
when the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)
when the wheels touch ground (when the wheels touch ground (when the wheels touch ground)
and you feel like it's all over
there's another round for you
when the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)
when the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)
when the wheels touch ground (when the wheels touch ground (when the wheels touch ground)
and you feel like it's all over
there's another round for you
when the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)
when the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)
when the wheels touch ground (when the wheels touch ground (when the wheels touch ground)
and you feel like it's all over
there's another round for you
when the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)
ain't that the way it always starts
a simple round of conversation
became a shameful equation
i flipped you station to station
hey, don't go and turn the other way
don't say there's nothin' more to say
come on, hear me out, hush, hush, settle down
button up, don't make a sound, shame, shame, go away
come again some other day
you used to say i couldn't save you enough
so i've been savin' it up, i started savin' it up
and when you said i couldn't give you enough
i started givin' you up, i started givin' you up
you are not me, arlandria, arlandria
you and what army, arlandria, arlandria?
oh, god, you gotta make it stop
chase all of those memories away
save them all for another day
don't you remember it was rain that drowned you
wait, i wanna see if you can shake
i want to keep all i can take
i feel much better now, use me up, spit me out
let me be your hand-me-down, fame, fame, go away
come again some other day
you used to say i couldn't save you enough
so i've been savin' it up, i started savin' it up
and when you said i couldn't give you enough
i started givin' you up, i started givin' you up
you are not me, arlandria, arlandria
you and what army, arlandria, arlandria?
oh, god, you gotta make it stop
my sweet virginia, i'm the same as i was in your arms
my sweet virginia, i'm the same as i was in your heart
shame, shame go away, come again some other day
memories keep hauntin' me, help me chase them all away
hush, now settle down, button-up, don't make a sound
close your eyes, turn around, help me burn this to the ground
come now, take the blame, that's okay, i'll play the game
i don't care, it's all the same, watch it all go up in flames
use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down
fame, fame, go away, come again some other day
you used to say i couldn't save you enough
so i've been savin' it up, i started savin' it up
and when you said i couldn't give you enough
i started givin' you up, i started givin' you up
you are not me, arlandria, arlandria
you and what army, arlandria, arlandria?
oh, god, you gotta make it stop
my sweet virginia, oh, god, you gotta make it stop
my sweet virginia, oh, god, you gotta make it stop
yes or no, what is truth?
but a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue?
i was wrong, i was right
i'm a blood moon born in the dead of night
break my bones, i don't care
all i ever wanted was a body to share
heart's gone cold, brush ran dry
satellite searching for a sign of life
like you, oh, oh, oh
somewhere, are you there?
the tears in your eyes
someday will dry
we fight for our lives
'cause everything's on the line
this time
listen close, i can't hide
i'm a page torn from a broken spine
sun gets low, i get high
satellite searching for a sign of life
like you, oh, oh, oh
somewhere, are you there?
the tears in your eyes
someday will dry
we fight for our lives
'cause everything's on the line
this time
are you there, are you there?
the tears in your eyes
someday will dry
we fight for our lives
'cause everything's on the line
this time
the tears in your eyes
someday will dry
we fight for our lives
'cause everything's on the line
yes or no, what is truth?
but a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue
i was wrong, i was right
i'm a blood moon born in the dead of night
there ain't no secrets anymore
my name's been hanging on the hook outside your door
just an old eyesore
i got this feeling, i can't keep it down anymore
bring me some healing
saint cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones
you're out of sight, i'm out of mind
been sitting watch your pictures drying on the line
just a game of mine
i got this feeling, i can't keep it down anymore
bring me some healing
saint cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones
i know no matter what i say
days will come and go
no matter what i say
nothing's set in stone
no matter what i say
days go by
i know no matter what i say
days will come and go
no matter what i say
nothing's set in stone
no matter what i say

you lost your mind, i could not go
what little time we spent a penny on the floor
my desperation, a spinning top
revolving on and on a world that never stops
is it all mine? how could i know?
we threw the rind away, swallowed all the core
tried levitation, you're not alone
the stars are holding open a door we'll never close
i have an engine made of gold
something so beautiful, the world will never know
our roots are stronger than you know
up through the concrete, they will grow
is it all mine? i can't let go
what little time we spent a penny on the floor
my desperation, is this a curse?
'til death do us part for better or for worse
i have an engine made of gold
something so beautiful the world will never know
our roots are stronger than you know
up through the concrete, they will grow
our roots are stronger than you know
up through the concrete, we will grow
fuck you, darrell
this indecision got me climbin' up the wall
been cheatin' gravity and waitin' on the fall
how did this come over me, i thought i was above it all?
our hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown
choke! on our kiss
thought i'd save my breath for you
choke! on our kiss
thought i'd save my breath for you
gimme some rope, i'm comin' noose, i'm hangin' on you
gimme some rope, i'm comin' loose, i'm pullin' for you now
give me some rope, i'm comin' outta my head, into the clear
when you go i come loose
these premonitions got me cryin' up a storm
leave your condition, this position does no harm
choke! on our kiss
thought i'd save my breath for you
choke! on our kiss
thought i'd save my breath for you
gimme some rope, i'm comin' noose, i'm hangin' on you
gimme some rope, i'm comin' loose, i'm pullin' for you now
give me some rope, i'm comin' outta my head, into the clear
when you go i come loose
gimme some rope, i'm comin' noose, i'm hangin' on you
gimme some rope, i'm comin' loose, i'm pullin' for you now
gimme some hope, i'm comin' through, i'm counting on you
gimme some rope, i'm comin' outta my head, into the clear
when you go i come loose
you believe there's something else
to relieve your emptiness
and you dream about yourself
and you bleed and breathe the air
and it's on and on and on and on (and on)
i just kind of died for you
you just kind of stared at me
we will always have the chance
we can do this one more time
hell yeah, i remember aurora
hell yeah, i remember aurora
all this time
hell yeah, i remember aurora
take me now
we can spin the sun around
and the stars will all come out
then we'll turn and come back down
turn and come back down
you believe there's somewhere else
where it's easier than this
and you see outside yourself
and you buy the hole you'll fill
and it's on and on and on and on (and on)
hell yeah, i remember aurora
hell yeah, i remember aurora
all this time
hell yeah, i remember aurora
take me now
we can spin the sun around
and the stars will all come out
then we'll turn and come back down
turn and come back down
on and and on, aurora wait for everyone
wait 'til the last one's done
on and and on, aurora wait for everyone
wait 'til the last one's done
take me now
we can spin the sun around
and the stars will all come out
then we'll turn and come back down
turn and come back down
turn and come back down
turn and come back down
tonight i'm tangled in my blanket of clouds
dreaming aloud
things just won't do without you
matter of fact
i'm on your back
i'm on your back
i'm on your back
if you walk out on me
i'm walking after you
if you walk out on me
i'm walking after you
if you'd accept surrender
i'll give up some more
weren't you adored
i cannot be without you
matter of fact
i'm on your back
i'm on your back
i'm on your back
if you walk out on me
i'm walking after you
if you walk out on me
i'm walking after you
another heart is cracked
in two
i'm on your back
i cannot be without you
matter of fact
i'm on your back
i'm on your back
i'm on your back
if you walk out on me
i'm walking after you
if you walk out on me
i'm walking after you
if you walk out on me
i'm walking after you
another heart is cracked
in two
i'm on your back
goddamn this dusty room
this hazy afternoon
i'm breathing in this silence like never before
this feeling that i get
this one last cigarette
as i lay awake and wait for you to come through that door
oh, maybe, maybe, maybe i can share it with you
i behave, i behave, i behave so i can share it with you
you are not alone, dear loneliness
you forgot, but i remember this
oh, stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know
i'm not alone, dear loneliness
i forgot that i remember this
so stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know
oh-oh, oh-oh
and i dream about somewhere
a smoke will fill the air
as i lay awake and wait for you to walk out that door
i can change, i can change, i can change
but who you want me to be?
i'm the same, i'm the same, i'm the same
what do you want me to be?
you are not alone, dear loneliness
you forgot, but i remember this
oh, stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know
oh-oh, oh-oh
i'm not alone, dear loneliness
i forgot that i remember this
you are not alone, dear loneliness
you forgot, but i remember this
oh, stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know
i'm not alone, dear loneliness
i forgot that i remember this
oh, stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened i know
oh-oh, oh-oh
the sun went down on another perfect day
busy counting shadows on the wall
the weeds are swallowing up the flower bed
roses in the whiskey jar, blood on the thorns
drink until the taste is gone
cracks in the floorboards are deep from dancing
to the sound of candles burning out
heavy from writing your resignations
licking bitter envelopes, blood on your tongue
drink until the taste is gone
where is your shangri-la now?
where is your shangri-la now?
counting down to zero hour
there ain't no superheroes now
there ain't no superheroes, they're underground
happy ever after, counting down to zero hour
there ain't no superheroes now
there ain't no superheroes, they're underground
happy ever after, counting down to zero hour
where is your shangri-la now?
where is your shangri-la now?
counting down to zero hour
there ain't no superheroes now
there ain't no superheroes, they're underground
happy ever after, counting down to zero hour
there ain't no superheroes now
there ain't no superheroes, they're underground
happy ever after, counting down to zero hour
heart of gold but it lost its pride
beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
i've seen your face in another light
why'd you have to go and let it die?
why'd you have to go and let it die?
why'd you have to go and let it die?
in too deep and out of time
why'd you have to go and let it die?
a simple man and his blushing bride
intravenous, intertwined (intravenous, intertwined)
hearts gone cold your hands were tied
(hearts gone cold your hands were tied)
why'd you have to go and let it die?
(why'd you have to go and let it die?)
why'd you have to go and let it die?
why'd you have to go and let it die?
in too deep and out of time
why'd you have to go and let it die?
do you ever think of me?
you're so considerate
do you ever think of me?
oh, so considerate
in too deep and lost in time
why'd you have to go and let it die?
beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
why'd you have to go and let it die?
hearts gone cold and hands are tied
why'd you have to go and let it die?
why'd you have to go and let it die?
do you ever think of me
you're so considerate
do you ever think of me
oh, so considerate
in too deep and lost in time
why'd you have to go and let it die?
beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
why'd you have to go and let it die?
hearts gone cold and hands are tied
why'd you have to go and let it die?
why'd you have to go and let this die?
why'd you have to go and let this die?
why'd you have to go and let this die?
why'd you have to go and let this die?
why'd you have to go and let it die?
here now don't make a sound
say have you heard the news today
one flag was taken down
to raise another in its place
a heavy cross you bear
a stubborn heart remains unchanged
no home, no life, no love
no stranger singing in your name
maybe the season
the colours change in the valley skies
dear god i've sealed my fate
running through hell, heaven can wait
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow, no dead end in sight
let's say we take this town
no king or queen of any state
get up to shut it down
open the streets and raise the gates
i know one wall to scale
i know a field without a name
head on without a care
before it's way too late
maybe the season
the colours change in the valley skies
dear god i've sealed my fate
running through hell, heaven can wait
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow, no dead ends
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow, no dead end in sight
for every piece to fall in place
forever gone without a trace
your horizon takes its shape
no turning back, don't turn that page
come now, i'm leaving here tonight
come now, let's leave it all behind
is that the price you pay
running through hell, heaven can wait
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow, no dead ends
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow, no dead ends
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow, no dead end in sight
come and i'll take you under
this beautiful bruise's colors
everything fades in time, it's true
wish that i had another
stab at the undercover
was it a change in mind for you?
it's impossible
i can't let it out
you'll never know
am i selling you out?
sit and watch
your every mood
mood
your eyes still remind me of
angels that hover above
eyes that can change from blind to blue
it's impossible
i can't let it out
you'll never know
am i selling you out?
sit and watch
your every mood
mood
now that i've found my reward
i'd throw it away long before
i'd share a piece of mine with you
it's impossible
i can't let it out
you'll never know
am i selling you out?
sit and watch
your every mood
mood
wish i were with you
but i couldn't stay
every direction
leads me away
pray for tomorrow
but for today
all i want is to be home
stand in the mirror
you look the same
just lookin' for shelter
from cold and the pain
someone to cover
safe from the rain
echoes and silence
patience and grace
all of these moments
i'll never replace
no fear of my heart
absence of faith
people i've loved
i have no regrets
some i remember
some i forget
some of them living
some of them dead
i should've known that it would end this way
i should've known there was no other way
didn't hear your warning, damn my heart gone deaf
i should've known, look at the shape you're in
i should've known, but i dove right in
one thing is for certain, as i'm standin' here, i should've known
lay your hands in mine
heal me one last time
no, i cannot forgive you yet
no, i cannot forgive you yet
you leave my heart in debt
i should've known, i was inside of you
i should've known there was that side of you
came without a warning, caught me unaware
i should've known, i've been here before
i should've known, don't want it anymore
one thing is for certain, i'm still standin' here, i should've known
lay your hands in mine
feel me one last time
no, i cannot forgive you yet
no, i cannot forgive you yet
you leave my heart in debt
no, i cannot forgive you yet
no, i cannot forgive you yet
you leave my heart in debt, i should have known
maybe you was right, didn't wanna fight
i should have known
couldn't read the signs, couldn't see the light
i should have known
no, i cannot forgive you yet
no, i cannot forgive you yet
you leave my heart in debt
no, i cannot forgive you yet
no, i cannot forgive you yet
you leave my heart in debt
no, i cannot forgive you yet
no, i cannot forgive you yet
you leave us all in debt, i should have known
you make me dizzy running circles in my head
one of these days i'll chase you down
well, look who's going crazy now
we're face to face my friend
better get out
better get out
you know you make me break out
make me break out
i don't want to look like that
i don't wanna look like that
you know you make me break out
make me break out
i don't want to look like that
i don't wanna look like that
you know you make me break out
you can see this on my face
it's all for you
the more and more i take
i break right through
therapy still scares me
putting me on my back again
i may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
one of these days i'll phase you out
burn it in the blast off, burn it in the blast off
watching me crawl away
try to get out, try to get out
break out
break out
break out
break out
you know you make me break out
make me break out
make me break out
yeah
and i met the seventh son
​he came for everyone
​the day he heard the lightning in the field
​i heard him clear his throat
​a fork within the road
​that night the tallahatchie took the wheel
i’ve been throwin' knives
​to see just where they'll land
​now, my world is in your hands
send in the congregation
​open your eyes, step in the light
​a jukebox generation
​just as you were
the voice upon the stage
​is the heart inside a cage
​and it's singing like a bluebird in the round
​there’s mystery in this wood
​and ghosts within these roots
​that are tangled deep beneath this southern ground
i’ve been goin' through life
​makin' foolish plans
​now, my world is in your hands
send in the congregation
​open your eyes, step in the light
​a jukebox generation
​just as you were, right?
just as you were
just as you were, alright!
and you need blind faith
​no false hope
no false hope
​do you have blind faith?
​no false hope
no false hope
​where is your blind faith?
​no false hope
no false hope
​open your eyes
open your eyes
​step into the light
​
open your eyes, step into the light
​the sound becomes congregation
a congregation
a congregation
yeah
and they're singing like a bluebird in the round
i'm hanging on
here until i'm gone
right where i belong
just hanging on
even though i watched you come and go
how was i to know
you'd steal the show?
one day i'll have enough to gamble
i'll wait to hear your final call
and bet it all
i'm hanging on
here until i'm gone
right where i belong
just hanging on
even though i pass this time alone
somewhere so unknown
it heals the soul
you ask for walls
i'll build them higher
we'll lie in the shadows of them all
i'd stand but they're much too tall
and i fall

since i'm putting down all of the true things around, but i like it
handed down the crown, given the jewels and the answers of may
the thought of being ousted comes and goes, comes and goes
when i think about it, the wind blows
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
run me out of town, somewhere a move might intended a gown at
pissed at all the bowels, always the blues and a delicate smile
missed all of the sideways, gull and noun, gull and noun
chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
good grief

oh mirror mirror, you're coming in clear

i'm impressed, what a beautiful chest
i never meant to make a big scene
will you resign to the latest design?
you look so messy when you dress up in dreams
one more for hire, a wonderful liar
i think it's time we all should come clean
stack dead actors, stacked to the rafters
line up the bastards all i want is the truth
hey hey now can you fake it?
can you make it look like we won?
hey hey now, can you take it?
and we cry when they all die blonde
god bless, what a sensitive mess
yeah, but things aren't always what they seem
your teary eyes, your famous disguise
never knowing who to believe
see through, yeah but what do you do?
when you're just another aging drag queen
stack dead actors, stacked to the rafters
line up the bastards all i want is the truth
hey hey now can you fake it?
can you make it look like we won?
hey hey now, can you take it?

oh, may i have this dance of days
locked in your embrace, passed your test of faith
another time, another place
another line upon your face, another in your way
down crooked stairs and sideways glances
comes the king of second chances, now throw him in the flame
whatever keeps you warm at night

oh, you know i did it
it's over and i feel fine
nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
waited and i waited the longest night
nothing like the taste of sweet decline
i was down, and i fell, i fell so fast
dropping like the grains in an hourglass
never say forever cause nothing lasts
dancing with the bones of my buried past
never mind there's nothing i could do
bet your life there's something killing you
it's a shame we have to die my dear
no one's getting out of here alive
this time
what a way to go, but have no fear
no one's getting out of here alive
this time
i'm finished, i'm getting you off my chest
made you come clean in a dirty dress
a promise is a promise you kept in check
hard to cross a heart that beats this fast
take a good hard look for the very last time
the very last one in a very long line
only took a second to say goodbye
been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine
never mind there's nothing i could do
bet your life there's something killing you
it's a shame we have to die my dear
no one's getting out of here alive
this time
what a way to go, but have no fear
no one's getting out of here alive
this time
ain't no way, doa
ain't no way, doa
take a good hard look for the very last time

only took a second to say goodbye
been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine
never mind there's nothing i could do

it's a shame we have to die my dear
no one's getting out of here alive

he needs a quiet room
with a lock to keep him in
it's just a quiet room
and he's there
he plays an old guitar
with a coin found by the phone
it was his friend's guitar
that he played
he's never been in love
but he knows just what love is
he says "nevermind"
and no one speaks
he thinks he drinks too much
'cause when he tells his two best friends
"i think i drink too much"
no one speaks
no one speaks
no one speaks
he plays an old guitar
with a coin found by the phone
it was his friend's guitar
that he played
when he plays
no one speaks
no one speaks
when he plays
no one speaks
("i can't let you guys  get off without screaming a couple of minutes
this one goes out to my sister lisa")
that night they were burning for truth
down on the corner of 14th and u
they took your soul and they took you for fools
took all the windows from prisons and schools
now, what's a poor man left to do?
one heart now broken in two
you start untying the hand of the youth
new kids hear the sound of the drumming
mother nature, your summer is coming
yesterday and today
revolution on its way
amen, it was the feast and the famine
amen, it was the feast and the famine
it was the feast and the famine
feast and the famine
crossroads with nothing to lose
out of the basement and into the news
come change, now shit getting heavy
salvation at the ready
you look when i walked by
still screaming "till i die"
you can't find peace if you can't find a home
you can't survive as an island alone
black heart with a gaping wound
put back together by a troubled groove
check yourself, wreck your brains
where is that p.m.a.?
amen, it was the feast and the famine
amen, it was the feast and the famine
it was the feast and the famine
feast and the famine
hey, where is the monument
to the dreams we forget?
we need a monument
and change will come
and change will come
is there anybody there? (anybody there?)
anybody there? (anybody there?)

but there's too many egos left to bruise
call it sin, you can call it whatever
eating deep inside of you
well if it were me it's all i'd ever do
steal me now and forever
i'll steal something good for you
the criminal in me is no one new
till you find something better
when there's nothing left to use
and everything starts going down on you
i'm the generator, firing whenever you quit
yeah whatever it is, you go out and it's on
yeah can't you hear my motored heart
you're the one that started it
send me out on a tether
swing it round i'll spin your noose

i'll hang around with you, till you find someone better
when there's no one left to use, and everyone keeps going down
 x2
i'll take it out of the wishing well, i'm thinkin' i have a plan
go on with your bad self, what do you see in yourself?
you think you're losin', it's time to stop accusin'

whoa!
woe is me
the end is near, thought you'd never leave
heart and teeth
just to taste bittersweet
one last stain to get beneath the skin
beneath the skin
the wish is drawn inside
the neverending sigh
no one lets everyone in
no one lets everyone in
my exit, no exit
no one lets everyone in
me and you
draw the line
now it's time to move
face to face
damn the luck, blessed be
heaven, what's come over me?
the wishes come inside
the neverending sigh

have you ever been dumb enough to do what you wanted to do
without good reason coming over you?
have you ever been young enough to feel what you wanted to feel?
take back those years for something real
i'm an iron rooster
cold and still
irregular sculpture
held against my will
have you ever been drunk enough to say what you wanted to say
without no words getting in the way?
have you ever been in love enough to be who you wanted to be?
i won't mind you if you won't mind me
i'm an iron rooster
cold and still
irregular sculpture
held against my will
can you believe we're older?
i won't believe it's over now
do you remember being children?
do you remember when? now
i'm an iron rooster
cold and still
irregular sculpture

i'm called a cow
i'm not about
to blow it now
for all the cows
for all the cows
it's funny how
money allows
all to browse
and be endowed
this wish is true
it falls into
pieces new
the cow is you
the cow is you
my kind has all run out
as if kinds could blend
some time if time allows
everything worn in
everything worn in
everything worn in like it's a friend
i said you're all
a painted doll
and it caused
the walls to fall
how far is he?
impatiently
that's as far as far can be
as far could be
my kind has all run out

there you are dancing at your altar
beautiful earthling, dressed in kashmir
all of your sound echoes through the canyons
down below they're dreaming
hear the sirens screaming
another time, another world
girls were boys and boys were girls
find the glitter in the litter
like a haunt, it's got to move
everybody needs some room
there's something out there
there's a long straight road
out of the cold
and we can leave it all behind
i wanna get outside
baby, let's get outside
i wanna get outside, outside — of me
oh, i found the space between the spaces
standing in the nothing, and time reclaims you
and as the wind will beat you down
and the wind the only sound
there's something out there
there's a long straight road
out of the cold
and we can leave it all behind
i wanna get outside
baby, let's get outside
i wanna get outside, outside — of me
there's a long straight road
out of the cold
and we can leave it all behind
i wanna get outside
baby, let's get outside
i wanna get outside, outside — of me
there is a secret, i found a secret
behind a soho door
there is a reason, i found a reason
beneath the subway floor
i found the water, the devil's water
and walked along its shore
is that what you want?
your channel's changing, the heart is racing
from voices on the wire
the soul is yearning, the coal is burning
the ember starts a fire
can we recover love for each other?
the measure of your life
is that what you want?
is that what you really want?
a river, a river
a river running underground
a river, a river
is that what you want?
is that what you really want?

i'm in the sky tonight
there i can keep by your side
watching the wide world riot and hiding out
i'll be coming home next year
into the sun we climb
climbing our wings will burn white
everyone strapped in tight
we'll ride it out
i'll be coming home next year
come on, get on, get on

exhausted

if it could be undone, will it

it's taught
and lost
blowing away, we stray wilted
exalted
at fault
what if the day had stayed in bed?
these baubles
we've brought
at fault
after the bliss has long ended
this caution
this fault
give me a breeze that's long winded
accosted
adult
arrested
calling on you, belladonna
poison to prepare
now you're gone i float along
like embers in the air
how could you understand?
rain your armies down upon me
march across my back
now or never, no surrender
until your flag goes black
how could you understand?
how could you understand?
am i the soldier that you want me to be?
crawling on my hands and knees
under attack
under attack again
am i the soldier that you want me to be?
running from my enemy
under attack
under attack again
on your orders, bricks and mortar
kingdoms to defend
saints and sinners make good prisoners
now your king is dead
how could you understand?
am i the soldier that you want me to be?
crawling on my hands and knees
under attack

real life is so hard
we hide in the stars
that's where our heads are
my head and your heart
this is a blackout
don't let it go to waste
this is a blackout
i want to detonate
when you are so far
i'm falling apart
lose all my sonar
you jam my radar
this is a blackout
don't let it go to waste
this is a blackout
i want to detonate
sometimes i feel i'm getting stuck
between the handshake and the fuck
you've got me on guard
i've got my head start
my head and your heart
the same in the stars
this is a blackout
don't let it go to waste
this is a blackout
i want to detonate
sometimes i wish that i could change
i can't save you from my poor brain
okay
you know in all of the time that we've shared
i've never been so scared
doll me up in my bad luck
i'll meet you there
i wish i never had taken this dare
i wasn't quite prepared
doll me up in my bad luck
doll me up in my bad luck
i'll meet you there
i can be your liar
i can be your bearer of bad news
sick and uninspired by the diamonds in your fire
burning like a flame inside of you
but  is this just desire or the truth?
so shame on me for the ruse
shame on me for the blues
another one returned that i'll never use
i won't go getting tired of you
i won't go getting tired of you
i'm not getting tired
i won't go getting tired of you
i won't go getting tired of you
i'm not getting tired
hanging on this wire
waiting for the day where i'll have to choose
cursed by love so dire
one more boy for hire
one more boy to lend a hand to you
is this just desire or the truth?
breathe oh breathe now smother me
so clever me, i'm onto you
my oh my, now testify
i'm guilty by my clouds on you
where you been?
how far'd you get?
i got this sin i saved for you
i don't need your remedy

there are days i might not make it
there are days i might start breaking
when the rain starts coming down as heavy as the air
you can find me dancing with the spirits in the square
goddamn i swear
there are times i feel like giving in
there are times i begin to begin again
look outside the world keeps spinning, like a paddle wheel
rolling for the broken hearted waiting on the heal
you know i'm not
in the clear
you are not
in the clear
don't you go count me out now dear
you know i'm not
in the clear

in the clear
don't you go count me out now dear
in the clear
there are places i don't remember
there are faces i don't remember
but how could i forget you, painting stars into the sky?
coming like a rebirth, marching in a second line
you know i'm not
in the clear
you are not
in the clear
don't you go count me out now dear
you know i'm not
in the clear
you are not

you know i'm not
in the clear
you are not
in the clear
don't you go count me out now dear
in the clear
and if i should drown
may this be the sound
to wash me out
you know i'm not
in the clear
you are not
in the clear
don't you go count me out now dear
you know i'm not
in the clear

let's change the subject to someone else
you know lately, i've been subject to change
normally, i reel in the strange
hangover, i'm older
you're one to talk the heart is a clock
just like a bomb that keeps on tickin' away
counting down to detonate
you will need an army disarmin' me
it doesn't matter much to me
if it doesn't matter much to you, ooh
it doesn't matter much to me
if it doesn't matter much to you
it's just a matter of time, before, before
it's just a matter of time, before, before
and though i hate to rewind, before, before
it's just a matter of time
my past is getting us nowhere fast
i was never one for takin' things slow
nowhere seems like somewhere to go
come over and over
doin' my time for line after line
when will i learn to sing these crimes to myself?
prisoners to share a cell with
i'm holdin', still holdin', holdin' it well
it doesn't matter much to me
if it doesn't matter much to you, ooh
it doesn't matter much to me
if it doesn't matter much to you
it's just a matter of time, before, before
it's just a matter of time, before, before
and though i hate to rewind, before, before
it's just a matter of time
where the hell were you, ooh
where the hell were you, ooh
where the hell were you!
it's just a matter of time, before, before
it's just a matter of time, before, before
and though i hate to rewind, before, before
it's just a matter of time
what does it matter now? what does it matter now?
what does it matter now? what does it matter now?
it's just a matter of time
time!
dear haley
can you save me from the borrowed cloud i'm on
all you gotta do is try
pray you're just getting by
hey wait i thought you'd made it
how'd your bottled crown fall off
tell me how'd you get so tired
faded down to the wire
try living a lie and kicking out the same old guise
wasting time, so very ordinary
wait until my bomb goes off
see the actors run and hide
fake it all in stride
one day we all can say we're gone
and haunt the ground we're from
everything's so open wide
here within the divide
try living a lie and kicking out the same old guise
wasting time
ain't it the life, got no crime, just sail on by
i was waiting for something
maybe flying machines
that's when i found lili
the best i've ever seen
put her on the ceiling
try to make her my own
people line up to see
but there never seems to be enough space

i never heard this warning, another early morning
takes me, wakes me into
if you could manage me, i'll try to manage you
but lately it's all i ever do
i felt like this on my way home
i'm not scared
i pass the boats and the kingdome
i'm not scared
i'll never tell you the secret i'm holding
i know these things must bore you
i can't find another way
i'll never tell you the secrets i'm holding
i love this leash that holds me
when i try to run away
i felt like this on my way home
i'm not scared
i pass the boats and the kingdome
i'm not scared
(x9)
i'm not scared...
something that i felt today, something that i heard
swinging from the chandeliers, hanging on your word
i remember watching you once upon a time
dancing from across the room in another life
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down, show me how
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down, show me how
looking back to find my way, never seemed so hard
yesterday's been laid to rest, changing of the guard
i would never change a thing even if i could
all the songs we used to sing, everything was good
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down, show me how
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down, show me how
one more year that you're not here
it's gone and passed you by
what happened to you, what happened to you
one more tear that you won't hear
that's gone and passed you by
what happened to you, what happened to you
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down, show me how
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down, show me how
a little bit of resolve
one more year that you're not here
it's gone and passed you by (a little bit of resolve)
a little bit of resolve
one more year that you're not here
it's gone and passed you by (a little bit of resolve)
ohh, ohh
moving, again
comfort of the chase
now and again
this my saving grace
dead on the inside i've got nothing to prove
keep me alive and give me something to lose
goodbye, this time
leaving you
i've been gone so long, so, gone so long
but i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
for you
ohh, ohh
changes, changing
back and forth again
trading faces
strangers in the end
dead on the inside i've got nothing to prove
keep me alive and give me something to lose
goodbye, this time
leaving you
i've been gone so long, so, gone so long
but i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
for you
for you
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
for you
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
i will come back
dearest constellation, heaven surrounding you
stay there, soft and blue. virginia moon, i'll wait for you tonight
sweetest invitation, breaking the day in two
feeling like i do, virginia moon, i'll wait for you tonight
and now our shades become shadows in your light
in the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you
i will say goodnight
secret fascination, whisper a quiet tune
hear me calling you, virginia moon, i'll wait for you tonight
virginia moon, i'll wait for you tonight
i will say goodnight
i will say goodnight
took the high dive into your brain
and you made your lonely calls
you just might wear your welcome out
if you don’t let it go
there’s nothing that you couldn’t say
'cause you’ve said it all before
i think it’s time you walked this lonely road
all on your own
it’s your cold day in the sun
looks like your bleeding heart has already won
i wish i could take it away
and save you from yourself
you get so lost inside your head like no one else
looking for someone to blame?
did you blame me all along?
you’ll take the heat
but you would never take the fall
it’s your cold day in the sun
looks like your bleeding heart has already won
you’re so afraid that you are the only one
you are the only one
you know
don’t be afraid because you’re not the only one
you’re not the only one
i know
it’s your cold day in the sun
looks like your bleeding heart has already won
it’s your cold day in the sun
looks like your bleeding heart has already won
thank you
crazy but i'm relieved this time
begging for sweet relief
a blessing in disguise
dying behind these tired eyes
i've been losing sleep
please come to me
tonight
hands on a miracle
i got my hands on a miracle
believe it or not, hands on a miracle
and there ain't no way
let you take it away
everything that we survived
it's gonna be alright
just lucky we're alive
got no vision i've been blind
searching everywhere you're right here in my sights
hands on a miracle
i got my hands on a miracle
believe it or not, hands on a miracle
and there ain't no way
let you take it away
(violin solo)
hands on a miracle
i got my hands on a miracle
believe it or not, hands on a miracle
i got my hands on a miracle
and there ain't no way
let you take it away
take it away
early morning without warning
woke me with a scare
i had that dream again
that the sun was dead
make me warm or take me home
it's so cold in here
can't we meet somewhere
is it winter there?
is it winter there?
this winter
meet me in the summertime
we can move the air
sweet virginia countryside
i will meet you there
golden lips and cherry wine
moonshine in your hair
just keep staring at the sun
pray for summer's end
come on over brave my storm
oceans overhead
come inside, my friend
getting bad out there
every moment we have stolen
all we have to share
no one wanted them
but you know i did
you know i did
this moment
meet me in the summertime
meet me in the summertime
meet me in the summertime
we can move the air
meet me in the summertime
i will meet you there
leading everything along
never far from being wrong
never mind these things at all
it's nothing
couldn't find a way to you
seems that's all i ever do
turning up in black and blue
rewarded
all the static we all left
wait until the time has come
figure that's where time comes from
leaving all my senses numb is heaven
lifted up the fay to seen
anything could never be
anything but play to me
in order
all the static we all left
take it back for them to keep
fallen into something deep
not that i had made that leap
anointed
all the static we all left
where have all the wishes gone?
now that all of that is done
wish i would've felt i'd won for once
the train that i got onto up and left that town
threw it up as it went down
strange enough, it left me rude and turned around
watched as they all took their vows
fools were drawing, trying to save that day
i don't doubt that anyway
phase it out until the older ones return
have a seat and watch it burn
trace around the corner, this is what i've learned
always waited for my turn
fools were drawing, trying to save that day
i don't doubt that anyway
fools were drawing, trying to save that day
i don't doubt that anyway
good bye jimmy, farewell youth
i? must be on my way i've had enough of you
was a young man, proud and true
just a simple boy with nothing left to lose
years that i've wasted
these i.o.u.'s
they're just fucking words
this is life or death
it's time to clear the air
you better save your breath
say have you heard
say have you heard
the poison in my heart
and voices in my head?
years that i've wasted
these i.o.u.'s
i meant every word for word for word forward
word for word for word forward
word for word for word forward
word for word for word forward
but it's only words
i meant every word
they're just fucking words
word for word for word forward
word for word for word forward
word for word for word forward
word for word for word forward
word for word for word forward
i can be your right of way
so we can get out of here
i've always been the one who runs from everyone
cause everyone's just too weird
sink with someone tied to me
i'm making you volunteer
another one has come and gone
they crawl along, make them disappear
dress me up in stitches
it's now or never
tired of wearing black and blue
dress me up in stitches
it's now or never
dying to get my blood on you
take another stab at me
i promise in time i'll heal
but yesterday went on and on a bit too long
i waited out on high street
there's nothing to find out here
another day has come and gone
they crawl along, wasting all these years
dress me up in stitches
it's now or never
tired of wearing black and blue
dress me up in stitches
it's now or never
dying to get my blood on you
how can you go on when you're murdering someone
killing me like you do
gimme stitches now or never
gimme stitches now or never
gimme stitches now or never
blood on you
blood on you
blood on you
blood on you
blood on you
dress me up in stitches it's now or never
tired of wearing black and blue
dress me up in stitches it's now or never
dying to get my blood on you
how can you go on when you're murdering someone
killing me like you do
gimme stitches now or never
gimme stitches now or never
gimme stitches now or never
gimme stitches now or never
blood on you
blood on you
call and i'll answer at home in the lost and found
you say that i'm much too proud
someone who's taking pleasure in breaking down
never mind mannequins drunk in their hollow town
drinking their spoils down
cheap imitations
the revelation is now
yeah, you won't find me i'm going m.i.a
tonight i'm leaving going m.i.a
getting lost in you again is better than being numb
counting every minute till the feeling comes crashing down
run when it hits the ground
i'm good at escaping
but better at flaking out
calling unanswered the center becomes blown out
stuck in the inside now
it's fear i'm embracing
i never could face you down
yeah, you won't find me i'm going m.i.a
tonight i'm leaving going m.i.a
getting lost in you again is better than being numb
red, red, laced around your head
cold and rescued, cold and rescued
cold and rescued, cold and rescued
cold and rescued, cold and rescued now
call and i'll answer at home in the lost and found
you say that i'm much too proud
someone who's taking pleasure in breaking down
yeah, you won't find me i'm going m.i.a
tonight i'm leaving going m.i.a
so you don't find me i'm going m.i.a
tonight i'm leaving going m.i.a
say goodbye​ to me i'm going m.i.a
i can find relief i'm going m.i.a
getting lost in you again is better than being numb
better than being numb
better than playing dumb
restless little one
comfortable and warm
let me fall apart
crippled in your arms
chase me through the dark
ready on your mark
first to reach the stars
wins a broken heart
one that broke apart
shattered from the start
are you there
do you read me
are you there
i don't feel you anymore
cages and alarms
keeping us from harm
i will be the guard
hope to rest upon
could i be the one
to break a will so strong
pray it won't be long
till your will is gone
everything is done
nothing left at all
are you there
do you read me
are you there
i don't feel you anymore
are you there
will you give in
are you there
if i give out
(ooh)
over and out
(ooh)
cages and alarms
keeping us from harm
i will be the guard
hope to rest upon
everything is done
nothing left at all
are you there
do you read me
are you there
i don't feel you anymore
are you there
will you give in
are you there
if i give out

have you been headwired
were you satisfied
did it free the feelings in your spine
sleeping way inside all this time
will you meet your mind where the night collides
will you greet yourself when the sun arrives
i'll just stay behind, i've met mine
better than a bullet being fired
tangled in your headwires now
better than a bullet being fired
tangled in your headwires, headwires now
help you feed the wires when your head unwinds
and if our headlines become entwined
you can have all mine, i'll be fine
there's a reason why keeping me alive
there's a cure in me that i wish were mine
as long as i can fight, i'll survive
better than a bullet being fired
tangled in your headwires now
better than a bullet being fired
tangled in your headwires, headwires
stationed on the wire (headwires)
one day i'll let go (headwires)
tell them all hello (headwires)
stationed on the wire (headwires)
one day i'll let go (headwires)
tell them all hello (headwires)
the sun is on arlandria
headwire...
