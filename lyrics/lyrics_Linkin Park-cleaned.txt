(it starts with one) one thing, i don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme
to explain in due time all i know
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (it's so unreal)
didn't look out below
watch the time go right out the window
tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
i wasted it all just to watch you go
i kept everything inside
and even though i tried, it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard
i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter
one thing, i don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme
to remind myself how i tried so hard
in spite of the way you were mockin' me
actin' like i was part of your property
rememberin' all the times you fought with me
i'm surprised it got so far
things aren't the way they were before
you wouldn't even recognize me anymore
not that you knew me back then
but it all comes back to me in the end
you kept everything inside
and even though i tried, it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard
i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i've put my trust in you
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
there's only one thing you should know
i've put my trust in you
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
there's only one thing you should know
i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i don’t like my mind right now
stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
wish that i could slow things down
i wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
and i drive myself crazy
thinking everything's about me
yeah, i drive myself crazy
'cause i can’t escape the gravity
i'm holding on
why is everything so heavy?
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around what's bringing me down
if i just let go, i'd be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy?
you say that i'm paranoid
but i’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
it’s not like i make the choice
to let my mind stay so fucking messy
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
i'm holding on
why is everything so heavy?
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around what's bringing me down
if i just let go, i'd be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy?
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
and i drive myself crazy
thinking everything’s about me
holding on
why is everything so heavy?
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around what's bringing me down
if i just let go, i'd be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy?
why is everything so heavy?
why is everything so heavy?
should've stayed, were there signs, i ignored?
can i help you, not to hurt, anymore?
we saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
there are things that we can have, but can't keep
if they say
who cares if one more light goes out?
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers, flickers
who cares when someone's time runs out?
if a moment is all we are
or quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out?
well i do
the reminders, pull the floor from your feet
in the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
and you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there
if they say
who cares if one more light goes out?
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers, flickers
who cares when someone's time runs out?
if a moment is all we are
or quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out?
well i do
(i do)
who cares if one more light goes out?
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers, flickers
who cares when someone's time runs out?
if a moment is all we are
or quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out?
well i do
well i do
i'm tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
i don't know what you're expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
can't you see that you're smothering me?
holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'cause everything that you thought i would be
has fallen apart, right in front of you
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
and every second i waste is more than i can take
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
and i know i may end up failing, too
but i know you were just like me
with someone disappointed in you
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
i'm tired of being what you want me to be
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
i'm tired of being what you want me to be
i got a long way to go
and a long memory
i been searching for an answer
always just out of reach
blood on the floor
sirens repeat
i been searching for the courage
to face my enemies
when they turn down the lights
i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake
for my battle symphony
for my battle symphony
they say that i don’t belong
say that i should retreat
that i’m marching to the rhythm
of a lonesome defeat
but the sound of your voice
puts the pain in reverse
no surrender, no illusions
and for better or worse
when they turn down the lights
i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake
if i fall, get knocked down
pick myself up off the ground
if i fall, get knocked down
pick myself up off the ground
when they turn down the lights
i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake
for my battle symphony
for my battle symphony
crawling in my skin
these wounds, they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming, confusing
this lack of self-control i fear is never ending
controlling, i can't seem
to find myself again, my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence
i'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
i've felt this way before, so insecure
crawling in my skin
these wounds, they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
distracting, reacting
against my will, i stand beside my own reflection
it's haunting how i can't seem
to find myself again, my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence
i'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
i've felt this way before, so insecure
crawling in my skin
these wounds, they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing, confusing what is real
(there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming) confusing what is real
(this lack of self-control i fear is never ending
controlling) confusing what is real
so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
live from the rhythm, it's
something wild, venomous
enemies trying to read me
you're all looking highly illiterate
blindly forgetting if i'm in the mix
you won't find an equivalent
i've been here killing it
longer than you've been alive, you idiot
and it makes you so mad
somebody else could be stepping in front of you
and it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
there's more than one of you
and you can't understand the fact
that it's over and done, hope you had fun
you've got a lot to discuss on the bus
headed back where you're from
so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
good goodbye
good goodbye
good goodbye
good goodbye
(wooh!)
goodbye, good riddance
a period is after every sentence
did my time with my cellmate
maxed out so now we finished
every day was like a hail date
every night was like a hailstorm
took her back to my tinted windows
showin' out, she in rare form
wings up, now i'm airborne
king push, they got a chair for him
make way for the new queen
the old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
consequence when you ain't there for him
were you there for him?
did you care for him?
you were dead wrong
(don't you come back no more)
so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
yo
let me say goodbye to my demons
let me say goodbye to my past life
let me say goodbye to the darkness
tell 'em that i'd rather be here in the starlight
tell 'em that i'd rather be here where they love me
tell 'em that i'm yours this is our life
and i still keep raising the bar like
never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
goodbye to the stereotypes
you can't tell my kings we can't
mandem we're linking tings in parks
now i got a tune with linkin park
like goodbye to my old hoe’s
goodbye to the cold roads
i can't die for my postcode
young little mike from the gold coast
and now i'm inside with my bro bro's
gang
so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
tell me what i've gotta do
there's no getting through to you
the lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)
you say i can't understand
but you're not giving me a chance
when you leave me, where do you go? (where do you go?)
all the walls that you keep building
all this time that i spent chasing
all the ways that i keep losing you
the truth is, you turn into someone else
you keep running like the sky is falling
i can whisper, i can yell
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
talking to myself
talking to myself
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
i admit i made mistakes
but yours might cost you everything
can't you hear me calling you home?
oh, all the walls that you keep building
all this time that i spent chasing
all the ways that i keep losing you
the truth is, you turned into someone else
you keep running like the sky is falling
i can whisper, i can yell
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
talking to myself
talking to myself
yeah i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
all the walls that you keep building
all this time that i spent chasing
all the ways that i keep losing you
the truth is, you turned into someone else
you keep running like the sky is falling
i can whisper, i can yell
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
talking to myself
talking to myself
yeah i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
talking to myself
memories consume, like opening the wound
i'm picking me apart again
you all assume i'm safe here in my room
unless i try to start again
i don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'cause inside, i realize that i'm the one confused
i don't know what's worth fighting for or why i have to scream
i don't know why i instigate and say what i don't mean
i don't know how i got this way, i know it's not alright
so, i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit tonight
clutching my cure, i tightly lock the door
i try to catch my breath again
i hurt much more than anytime before
i had no options left again
i don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'cause inside, i realize that i'm the one confused
i don't know what's worth fighting for or why i have to scream
i don't know why i instigate and say what i don't mean
i don't know how i got this way, i'll never be alright
so, i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit tonight
i'll paint it on the walls 'cause i'm the one at fault
i'll never fight again and this is how it ends
i don't know what's worth fighting for or why i have to scream
but now i have some clarity to show you what i mean
i don't know how i got this way, i'll never be alright
so, i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit
i’m breaking the habit tonight
i'm dancing with my demons
i'm hanging off the edge
storm clouds gather beneath me
waves break above my head
headfirst hallucination
i wanna fall wide awake now
you tell me it's alright
tell me i'm forgiven, tonight
but nobody can save me now
i'm holding up a light
i'm chasing out the darkness inside
'cause nobody can save me
stared into this illusion
for answers yet to come
i chose a false solution
but nobody proved me wrong
headfirst hallucination
i wanna fall wide awake
watch the ground giving way now
you tell me it's alright
tell me i'm forgiven, tonight
but nobody can save me now
i'm holding up a light
i'm chasing out the darkness inside
'cause nobody can save me
been searching somewhere out there
for what's been missing right here (i wanna fall wide awake now)
i've been searching somewhere out there
for what's been missing right here (i wanna fall wide awake now)
i wanna fall wide awake now
so tell me it's alright
tell me i'm forgiven, tonight
and only i can save me now
i'm holding up a light
chasing out the darkness inside
and i don't wanna let you down
but only i can save me!
been searching somewhere out there
for what's been missing right here
in this farewell
there's no blood, there's no alibi
'cause i've drawn regret
from the truth of a thousand lies
so let mercy come and wash away
what i've done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i've become
erase myself
and let go of what i've done
put to rest what you thought of me
while i clean this slate
with the hands of uncertainty
so let mercy come and wash away
what i've done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i've become
erase myself
and let go of what i've done
for what i've done
i start again
and whatever pain may come
today this ends
i'm forgiving what i've done
what i've done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i've become
erase myself
and let go of what i've done
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
what i've done
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
forgiving what i've done
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
take me down to the river bend
take me down to the fighting end
wash the poison from off my skin
show me how to be whole again
fly me up on a silver wing
past the black where the sirens sing
warm me up in a nova's glow
and drop me down to the dream below
'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see
bring me home in a blinding dream
through the secrets that i have seen
wash the sorrow from off my skin
and show me how to be whole again
'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there, for you to see
for you to see
'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything else i need to be
'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see, for you to see
(when this began) i had nothing to say
and i'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(i was confused) and i let it all out to find
that i'm not the only person with these things in mind
(inside of me) but all the vacancy the words revealed
is the only real thing that i've got left to feel
(nothing to lose) just stuck, hollow and alone
and the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain i've held so long
erase all the pain 'til it's gone
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
like i'm close to something real
i wanna find something i've wanted all along
somewhere i belong
and i've got nothing to say
i can't believe i didn't fall right down on my face
(i was confused) looking everywhere, only to find
that it's not the way i had imagined it all in my mind
(so what am i?) what do i have but negativity?
'cause i can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(nothing to lose) nothing to gain, hollow and alone
and the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain i've held so long
erase all the pain 'til it's gone
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
like i'm close to something real
i wanna find something i've wanted all along
somewhere i belong
i will never know myself until i do this on my own
and i will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
i will never be anything 'til i break away from me
i will break away, i'll find myself today
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain i've held so long
erase all the pain 'til it's gone
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
like i'm close to something real
i wanna find something i've wanted all along
somewhere i belong
i wanna heal
i wanna feel like i'm somewhere i belong
i wanna heal
i wanna feel like i'm somewhere i belong
somewhere i belong
i dreamed i was missing, you were so scared
but no one would listen 'cause no one else cared
after my dreaming, i woke with this fear
what am i leaving when i'm done here?
so, if you're asking me, i want you to know
when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
and don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
don't be afraid, i've taken my beating
i've shared what i made
i'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
i've never been perfect, but neither have you
so, if you're asking me, i want you to know
when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
you've learned to hide so well
pretending someone else
can come and save me from myself
i can't be who you are
when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
you've learned to hide so well
pretending someone else
can come and save me from myself
i can't be who you are
i can't be who you are
i am a little bit of loneliness
a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints, but i can't help the fact
that everyone can see these scars
i am what i want you to want
what i want you to feel
but, it's like no matter what i do
i can't convince you to just believe this is real
so, i let go, watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i'm not
but, i'll be here 'cause you're all that i got
i can't feel the way i did, before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal this damage, anymore
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
i am a little bit insecure
a little unconfident
'cause you don't understand, i do what i can
but sometimes, i don't make sense
i am what you never wanna say
but, i've never had a doubt
it's like no matter what i do, i can't convince you
for once, just to hear me out
so, i let go, watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i'm not
but, i'll be here 'cause you're all that i've got
i can't feel the way i did, before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal this damage, anymore
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
no, hear me out, now
you're gonna listen to me, like it or not
right now, hear me out, now
you're gonna listen to me, like it or not
right now
i can't feel the way i did before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
i can't feel the way i did, before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal this damage, anymore
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
i can't feel
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
why does it feel like night today?
something in here's not right today
why am i so uptight today?
paranoia's all i got left
i don't know what stressed me first
or how the pressure was fed
but i know just what it feels like
to have a voice in the back of my head
like a face that i hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time i lie
a face that laughs every time i fall
(and watches everything)
so i know that when it's time to sink or swim
that the face inside is here in me
right underneath my skin
it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
i know i've got a face in me
points out all my mistakes to me
you've got a face on the inside, too
and your paranoia's probably worse
i don't know what set me off first
but i know what i can't stand
everybody acts like the fact of the matter
is i can't add up to what you can
but everybody has a face that they hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time they lie
a face that laughs every time they fall
(and watches everything)
so you know that when it's time to sink or swim
that the face inside is watching you, too
right inside your skin
it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin
the sun goes down
i feel the light betray me
the sun goes down
i feel the light betray me
(the sun) it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
(i feel the light betray me)
(the sun) it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
(i feel the light betray me)
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
hand grenade pins in every line
throw 'em up and let something shine
going out of my fucking mind
filthy mouth, no excuse
find a new place to hang this noose
string me up from atop these roofs
knot it tight so i won't get loose
truth is, you can stop and stare
bled myself out and no one cares
dug the trench out, laid down there
with a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
yeah, someone pour it in
make it a dirt dance floor, again
say your prayers and stomp it out
when they bring that chorus in
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out
go, stop the show
choppy words and a sloppy flow
shotgun opera, lock and load
cock it back and then watch it go
mama, help me, i've been cursed
death is rolling in every verse
candy paint on his brand new hearse
can't contain him, he knows he works
fuck, this hurts, i won't lie
doesn't matter how hard i try
half the words don't mean a thing
and i know that i won't be satisfied
so why try ignoring him?
make it a dirt dance floor again
say your prayers and stomp it out
when they bring that chorus in
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out
i've opened up these scars
i'll make you face this
i've pulled myself so far
i'll make you face this now
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out
i bleed it out
i bleed it out
this is not the end, this is not the beginning
just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
and though the words sound steady, something empty's within them
we say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear
waiting for the end to come
wishing i had strength to stand
this is not what i had planned
it's out of my control
flying at the speed of light
thoughts were spinning in my head
so many things were left unsaid
it's hard to let you go
i know what it takes to move on
i know how it feels to lie
all i want to do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i haven't got
sitting in an empty room
trying to forget the past
this was never meant to last
i wish it wasn't so
i know what it takes to move on
i know how it feels to lie
all i want to do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i haven't got
what was left when that fire was gone?
i thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
all caught up in the eye of the storm
and trying to figure out what it's like moving on
and i don't even know what kind of things i said
my mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
so, i'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
the hardest part of ending is starting again
all i want to do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i haven't got
this is not the end, this is not the beginning
just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
i'm holding on to what i haven't got
but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
though the words sound steady
something empty's within them
we say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
holding on to what i haven't got
'cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear
the cycle repeated
as explosions broke in the sky
all that i needed
was the one thing i couldn't find
and you were there at the turn
waiting to let me know
we're building it up to break it back down
we're building it up to burn it down
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
the colors conflicted
as the flames climbed into the clouds
i wanted to fix this
but couldn't stop from tearing it down
and you were there at the turn
caught in the burning glow
and i was there at the turn
waiting to let you know
we're building it up to break it back down
we're building it up to burn it down
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
you told me yes, you held me high
and i believed when you told that lie
i played soldier, you played king
and struck me down when i kissed that ring
you lost that right to hold that crown
i built you up but you let me down
so when you fall, i'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
and you were there, at the turn
waiting to let me know
we're building it up to break it back down
we're building it up to burn it down
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
when you fall, i'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
when you fall, i'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
i've got an aching head
echoes and buzzing noises
i know the words we said
but wish i could've turned our voices down
this is not black and white
only organized confusion
i'm just trying to get it right
and in spite of all i should've done
i was not mad at you
i was not trying to tear you down
the words that i could've used
i was too scared to say out loud
if i cannot break your fall
i'll pick you up right off the ground
if you felt invisible, i won't let you feel that now
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
you didn't get your way
and it's an empty feeling
you've got a lot to say
and you just want to know you're being heard
but this is not black and white
there are no clear solutions
i'm just trying to get it right
and in spite of all i should've done
i was not mad at you
i was not trying to tear you down
the words that i could've used
i was too scared to say out loud
if i cannot break your fall
i'll pick you up right off the ground
if you felt invisible, i won't let you feel that now
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
this is not black and white
there are no clear solutions
i'm just trying to get it right
and in spite of all i should've done
i was not mad at you
i was not trying to tear you down
the words that i could've used
i was too scared to say out loud
if i cannot break your fall
i'll pick you up right off the ground
if you felt invisible, i won't let you feel that now
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
yeah, yo
you were that foundation
never gonna be another one, no
i followed, so taken
so conditioned, i could never let go
then sorrow, then sickness
then the shock when you flip it on me
so hollow, so vicious
so afraid, i couldn't let myself see
that i could never be held
back or up, no, i hold myself
check the rep, yep, you know mine well
forget the rest, let them know my hell
there and back, yet my soul ain't sell
kept respect up, the best they fell
let the rest be the tale they tell
that i was there, saying
in these promises broken, deep below
each word gets lost in the echo
so, one last lie i can see through
this time, i finally let you go, go, go
test my will, test my heart
let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
y'all go hard, i go smart
how's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
i've seen that, frustration
been crossed and lost and told no
and i've come back, unshaken
let down and lived and let go
so, you can let it be known
i don't hold back, i hold my own
i can't be mapped, i can't be cloned
i can't c-flat, it ain't my tone
i can't fall back, i came too far
hold myself up and love my scars
let the bells ring wherever they are
'cause i was there, saying
in these promises broken, deep below
each word gets lost in the echo
so, one last lie i can see through
this time, i finally let you go!
no, you can tell 'em all now
i don't back up, i don't back down
i don't fold up and i don't bow
i don't roll over, don't know how
i don't care where the enemies are
can't be stopped, all i know, go hard
won't forget how i got this far
for every time, saying
in these promises broken deep below
each word gets lost in the echo
so, one last lie i can see through
this time, i finally let you go, go, go
go, go, go, go
i cannot take this anymore
saying everything i've said before
all these words they make no sense
i find bliss in ignorance
less i hear, the less you'll say
you'll find that out anyway
just like before
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
i'm about to break)
i find the answers aren't so clear
wish i could find a way to disappear
all these thoughts they make no sense
i find bliss in ignorance
nothing seems to go away
over and over again
just like before
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
i'm about to break)
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to)
break
shut up when i'm talking to you
shut up
shut up
shut up
shut up when i'm talking to you
shut up
shut up
shut up
shut up
i'm about to break
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
i'm about to break)
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to)
break
mama always told me don't you run
"don't you run with scissors, son
you're gonna hurt someone"
mama told me look before you leap
always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep
stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said
sharp edges have consequences, i
guess that i had to find out for myself
sharp edges have consequences, now
every scar is a story i can tell
should've played it safer from the start
loved you like a house of cards
let it fall apart
but all the things i couldn't understand
never could've planned
they made me who i am
put your nose in paperbacks
instead of smoking cigarettes
these are years you're never getting back
stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said
sharp edges have consequences, i
guess that i had to find out for myself
sharp edges have consequences, now
every scar is a story i can tell
we all fall down
we live somehow
we learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
we all fall down
we live somehow
we learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said
sharp edges have consequences, i
guess that i had to find out for myself
sharp edges have consequences, now
every scar is a story i can tell
we all fall down
we live somehow
we learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
we all fall down
we live somehow
we learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
watching the wings cut through the clouds
watching the raindrops blinking red and white
thinking of you back on the ground
there with a fire burning in your eyes
i only halfway apologized
and i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
sometimes things refuse
to go the way we planned
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there will be a day
that you will understand
you will understand
after a while you may forget
but just in case the memories cross your mind
you couldn't know this when i left
under the fire of your angry eyes
i never wanted to say goodbye
so i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
sometimes things refuse
to go the way we planned
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there will be a day
that you will understand
you will understand
yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up
tried to call home but nobody could wait up
switch your time zones can't pick the pace up
i just passed out by the time you wake up
best things come to those who wait
and it's bound to get rough on any road you take
but don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake
i can't wait to come back when i'm going away
so i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there are things we have to do that we can't stand
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there will be a day that you will understand
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there are things we have to do that we can't stand
(things we have to do that we can't stand)
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there will be a day that you will understand
you will understand
you will understand
you will understand
i watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
shining with the light from the sun
the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
the moon's gonna owe it one
it makes me think of how you act to me
you do favors and then rapidly
just turn around and start asking me
about things that you want back from me
i'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place, to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
i want to be in another place
i hate when you say you don't understand
(you'll see it's not meant to be)
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
a place for my head
(maybe someday i'll be just like you and)
step on people like you do and
run away the people i thought i knew
i remember back then who you were
you used to be calm, used to be strong
used to be generous but you should've known
that you'd wear out your welcome
and now you see how quiet it is, all alone
i'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
i'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
i want to be in another place
i hate when you say you don't understand
(you'll see it's not meant to be)
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
a place for my head
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
i want to be in another place
i hate when you say you don't understand
(you'll see it's not meant to be)
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
a place for my head
stay away
i am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
i'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
stay away from me
i close both locks below the window
i close both blinds and turn away
sometimes solutions aren't so simple
sometimes goodbye's the only way
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
in cards and flowers on your window
your friends all plead for you to stay
sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
sometimes goodbye's the only way
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
i remembered black skies
the lightning all around me
i remembered each flash
as time began to blur
like a startling sign
that fate had finally found me
and your voice was all i heard
that i get what i deserve
so give me reason
to prove me wrong
to wash this memory clean
let the floods cross
the distance in your eyes
give me reason
to fill this hole
connect this space between
let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
across this new divide
there was nothing in sight
but memories left abandoned
there was nowhere to hide
the ashes fell like snow
and the ground caved in
between where we were standing
and your voice was all i heard
that i get what i deserve
so give me reason
to prove me wrong
to wash this memory clean
let the floods cross
the distance in your eyes
across this new divide
in every loss in every lie
in every truth that you deny
and each regret and each goodbye
was a mistake too great to hide
and your voice was all i heard
that i get what i deserve
so give me reason
to prove me wrong
to wash this memory clean
let the floods cross
the distance in your eyes
give me reason
to fill this hole
connect this space between
let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
across this new divide
across this new divide
across this new divide
weep not for roads untraveled
weep not for paths left lone
'cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
it's the worst kind of pain i've known
give up your heart, left broken
and let that mistake pass on
'cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
and in time, you'll be glad it's gone
whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
weep not for roads untraveled
weep not for sights unseen
may your love never end, and if you need a friend
there's a seat here alongside me
whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
used to get high with the dead end kids
abandoned houses where the shadows lived
i never been higher than i was that night
i woke up driving my car
i couldn't see then what i see right now
the road dissolving like an empty vow
couldn't remember where i'd been that night
i knew i took it too far
all you said to do was slow down
i remember, now i remember
all you said to do was slow down
but i was already gone
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
i know what i want, but it feels like i'm paralyzed
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right (halfway right)
told me "kid, you're going way too fast
you burn too bright, you know you'll never last"
it was bullshit then, i guess it makes sense now
i woke up driving my car
said i'd lose you if i lost control
i just laughed because what do they know?
here i am, standing all alone
because i took it too far
all you said to do was slow down
i remember, now i remember
all you said to do was slow down
but i was already gone
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
i know what i want, but it feels like i'm paralyzed
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right , halfway right
na na na na na na na na
nana nana, na nana nana
na na na na na na na na
but i was already gone
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
na na na na na na na na
nana nana, na nana nana
na na na na na na na na
but i was already gone
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
when you were standing in the wake of devastation
when you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
and with the cataclysm raining down
insides crying, "save me now"
you were there, impossibly alone
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure's all you've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go, let it go
and in a burst of light that blinded every angel
as if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
you felt the gravity of tempered grace
falling into empty space
no one there to catch you in their arms
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go, let it go
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure's all you've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go
let it go
let it go
let it go
let it go
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure's all you've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go, let it go
forfeit the game before somebody else
takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
cover up your face, you can't run the race
the pace is too fast, you just won't last
you love the way i look at you
while taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
you take away if i give in
my life, my pride is broken
you like to think you're never wrong
you live what you've learned
you have to act like you're someone
you live what you've learned
you want someone to hurt like you
you live what you've learned
you want to share what you have been through
you live what you've learned
you love the things i say i do
the way i hurt myself again, just to get back at you
you take away, when i give in
my life, my pride is broken
you like to think you're never wrong
you live what you've learned
you have to act like you're someone
you live what you've learned
you want someone to hurt like you

god bless us everyone
we're a broken people living under loaded gun
and it can't be outfought

and when i close my eyes tonight
to symphonies of blinding light!
god bless us everyone
we're a broken people living under loaded gun
oh, like memories in cold decay
transmissions echoing away
far from the world of you and i
where oceans bleed into the sky!
god save us everyone
will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
for the sins of our hand
the sins of our tongue
the sins of our father
the sins of our young? no!
god save us everyone
will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?

turn my mic up louder, i got to say something
lightweights step it aside when we come in
feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping
people on the street, they panic and start running
words on loose leaf sheet complete coming
i jump in my mind and summon the rhyme i'm dumping
healing the blind, i promise to let the sun in
sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming
jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
fuck that, i wanna see some fists pumping
risk something, take back what's yours
say something that you know they might attack you for
'cause i'm sick of being treated like i have before
like it's stupid standing for what i'm standing for
like this war's really just a different brand of war
like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
like they understand you in the back of the jet
when you can't put gas in your tank
and these fuckers are laughing their way to the bank
cashing the check
asking you to have compassion and have some respect
for a leader so nervous in an obvious way
stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
and the rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
in the living room laughing like, "what did he say?"
amen, amen
amen, amen
amen
in my living room watching but i am not laughing
'cause when it gets tense, i know what might happen
the world is cold, the bold men take action
have to react or get blown into fractions
ten years old, it's something to see
another kid my age drugged under a jeep
taken and bound and found later under a tree
i wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
do you see the soldiers that are out, today?
they brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
it's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
but a bomb blew the mosque up, yesterday
there's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
inside your market, your shops, your clothes
my dad, he's got a lot of fear, i know
but enough pride inside not to let that show
my brother had a book he would hold with pride
a little red cover with a broken spine on the back
he hand-wrote a quote, inside
"when the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"
meanwhile, the leader just talks away
stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
the rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
both scared and angry, like "what did he say?"
amen, amen
amen, amen
amen
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
waking in sweat again
another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
stuck in my head again
feels like i'll never leave this place, there's no escape
i'm my own worst enemy...
i've given up, i'm sick of feeling
is there nothing you can say?
take this all away, i'm suffocating
tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
i don't know what to take
thought i was focused but i'm scared, i'm not prepared
i hyperventilate
looking for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares
i'm my own worst enemy
i've given up, i'm sick of feeling
is there nothing you can say?
take this all away, i'm suffocating
tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
god!
put me out of my misery!
put me out of my misery!
put me out of my
put me out of my fucking misery!
i've given up, i'm sick of feeling
is there nothing you can say?
take this all away, i'm suffocating
tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
i don't know who to trust, no surprise
everyone feels so far away from me
heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
trying not to break, but i'm so tired of this deceit
every time i try to make myself get back up on my feet
all i ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
and how trying to put my trust in you
just takes so much out of me
(i) take everything from the inside
and throw it all away
'cause i swear, for the last time
i won't trust myself with you
tension is building inside, steadily
everyone feels so far away from me
heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me
trying not to break, but i'm so tired of this deceit
every time i try to make myself get back up on my feet
all i ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
and how trying to put my trust in you
just takes so much out of me
(i) take everything from the inside
and throw it all away
'cause i swear, for the last time
i won't trust myself with you
i won't waste myself on you
you
you
waste myself on you
you
you
i'll take everything from the inside
and throw it all away
'cause i swear, for the last time
i won't trust myself with you
everything from the inside
and just throw it all away
'cause i swear, for the last time
i won't trust myself with you
you
you
when i pretend everything is what i want it to be
i look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
when i pretend, i can forget about the criminal i am
stealing second after second, just 'cause i know i can
but, i can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
i'm just (trying to bend the truth)
i can't pretend i'm who you want me to be
so i'm (lying my way from)
you (no, no turning back, now)
i wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(no, no turning back, now)
let me take back my life
i’d rather be all alone (no turning back, now)
anywhere on my own, 'cause i can see
(no, no turning back, now)
the very worst part of you is me
i remember what they taught to me
remember condescending talk of who i ought to be
remember listening to all of that and this, again
so, i pretended up a person who was fitting in
and now, you think this person really is me
and i'm (trying to bend the truth)
but the more i push, the more i'm pulling away
'cause i'm (lying my way from)
you (no, no turning back, now)
i wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(no, no turning back, now)
let me take back my life
i’d rather be all alone (no turning back, now)
anywhere on my own, 'cause i can see
(no, no turning back, now)
the very worst part of you
the very worst part of you is me
this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said
would have you running from me, like this
this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said
would have you running from me, like this
(this) this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said
would have you running from me, like this
(this) this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said
would have you running from me, like this
you (no turning back, now)
i wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(no, no turning back, now)
let me take back my life
i’d rather be all alone (no turning back, now)
anywhere on my own, 'cause i can see
(no, no turning back, now)
the very worst part of you
the very worst part of you is me
there's an emptiness tonight
a hole that wasn't there before
and i keep reaching for the light
but i can't find it anymore
there's an emptiness tonight
a heavy hand that pulls me down
they say it's gonna be alright
but can't begin to tell me how
and i ask myself out loud...
"have i been lost all along?
was there something i could say, or something i should not have done?
was i lost all along?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?"
is there sunshine where you are?
the way there was when you were here
'cause i'm just sitting in the dark
in disbelief that this is real
in disbelief that this is real
have i been lost all along?
was there something i could say or something i should not have done?
was i lost all along?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?
and i ask myself out loud...
"have i been lost all along?
was there something i could say or something i should not have done?
was i lost all along?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?"
tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say
and suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'cause i don't have a reason and you don't have the time
but we both keep on waiting for something we won't find
the light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
with shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
we said it was forever, but then it slipped away
standing at the end of the final masquerade
the final masquerade
all i ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
all you ever wanted, the truth i couldn't speak
'cause i can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime
but we both keep on waiting, for what we left behind
the light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
with shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
we said it was forever, but then it slipped away
standing at the end of the final masquerade
the final masquerade
the final masquerade
standing at the end of the final masquerade
the light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
with shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
we said it was forever, but then it slipped away
standing at the end of the final masquerade
standing at the end of the final masquerade
standing at the end of the final masquerade
the final masquerade
when you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world
your instincts telling you to run
listen to your heart, those angel voices
they'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
it keeps us kind
when you've suffered enough and your spirit is breaking
you're growing desperate from the fight
remember you're loved and you always will be
this melody will bring you right back home
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
i woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
and put my cold feet on the floor
forgot all about yesterday
remembering i'm pretending to be where i'm not anymore
a little taste of hypocrisy
and i'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
and though you're so close to me
you're still so distant and i can't bring you back
it's true, the way i feel
was promised by your face
the sound of your voice
painted on my memories
even if you're not with me
i'm with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
i hit you and you hit me back
we fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
fine line between this and that
when things go wrong, i pretend the past isn't real
now i'm trapped in this memory
and i'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
so even though you're close to me
you're still so distant and i can't bring you back
it's true the way i feel
was promised by your face
the sound of your voice
painted on my memories
even if you're not with me
i'm with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
no, no matter how far we've come
i can't wait to see tomorrow
no matter how far we've come
i, i can't wait to see tomorrow
with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
it's easier to run
replacing this pain with something numb
it's so much easier to go
than face all this pain here all alone
something has been taken
from deep inside of me
a secret i've kept locked away
no one can ever see
wounds so deep, they never show
they never go away
like moving pictures in my head
for years and years they've played
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
if i could take all the shame to the grave, i would
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
i would take all my shame to the grave
it's easier to run
replacing this pain with something numb
it's so much easier to go
than face all this pain here all alone
sometimes, i remember
the darkness of my past
bringing back these memories
i wish i didn't have
sometimes, i think of letting go
and never looking back
and never moving forward, so
there'd never be a past
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
if i could take all the shame to the grave, i would
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
i would take all my shame to the grave
just washing it aside
all of the helplessness inside
pretending i don't feel misplaced
is so much simpler than change
it's easier to run
replacing this pain with something numb
it's so much easier to go
than face all this pain here all alone
it's easier to run
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made
it's easier to go
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
i would take all my shame to the grave
what do i do to ignore them behind me?
do i follow my instincts blindly?
do i hide my pride from these bad dreams
and give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
do i sit here and try to stand it?
or do i try to catch them red-handed?
do i trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
or do i trust nobody and live in loneliness?
because i can't hold on when i'm stretched so thin
i make the right moves, but i'm lost within
i put on my daily façade, but then
i just end up getting hurt again
by myself (myself) i ask why
(but in my mind, i find) i can't rely on myself
(myself) i ask why
(but in my mind, i find) i can't rely on myself
i can't hold on (to what i want when i'm stretched so thin)
it's all too much to take in
i can't hold on (to anything, watching everything spin)
with thoughts of failure sinking in
if i turn my back, i'm defenseless
and to go blindly seems senseless
if i hide my pride and let it all go on
then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
if i let them go, i'll be outdone
but if i try to catch them, i'll be outrun
if i'm killed by the questions like a cancer
then i'll be buried in the silence of the answer
by myself (myself) i ask why
(but in my mind, i find) i can't rely on myself
(myself) i ask why
(but in my mind, i find) i can't rely on myself
i can't hold on (to what i want when i'm stretched so thin)
it's all too much to take in
i can't hold on (to anything, watching everything spin)
with thoughts of failure sinking in
how do you think i've lost so much?
i'm so afraid that i'm out of touch
how do you expect i will know what to do
when all i know is what you tell me to?
don't you (know)
i can't tell you how to make it (go)
no matter what i do, how hard i (try)
i can't seem to convince myself (why)
i'm stuck on the outside
don't you (know)
i can't tell you how to make it (go)
no matter what i do, how hard i (try)
i can't seem to convince myself (why)
i'm stuck on the outside
i can't hold on (to what i want when i'm stretched so thin)
it's all too much to take in
i can't hold on (to anything, watching everything spin)
with thoughts of failure sinking in
i can't hold on (to what i want when i'm stretched so thin)
it's all too much to take in
i can't hold on (to anything, watching everything spin)
with thoughts of failure sinking
nothing ever stops all these thoughts
and the pain attached to them
sometimes i wonder why this is happening
it's like nothing i could do will distract me when
i think of how i shot myself in the back again
'cause from the infinite words, i could say
i put all the pain you gave to me on display
but didn't realize, instead of setting it free
i took what i hated and made it a part of me
it never goes away
it never goes away
and now, you've become a part of me
(you'll always be right here)
you've become a part of me
(you'll always be my fear)
i can't separate
(myself from what i've done)
giving up a part of me
i've let myself become you
hearing your name, the memories come back again
i remember when it started happening
i'd see you in every thought i had, and then
the thoughts slowly found words attached to them
and i knew as they escaped away
i was committing myself to them, and everyday
i regret saying those things, 'cause now
i see that i took what i hated and made it a part of me
it never goes away
it never goes away
and now, you've become a part of me
(you'll always be right here)
you've become a part of me
(you'll always be my fear)
i can't separate
(myself from what i've done)
giving up a part of me
i've let myself become you
never goes away, never goes away
it never goes away, it never goes away
(get away from me)
gimme my space back, you gotta just (go)
everything comes down to memories of (you)
i've kept it in, but now i'm letting you (know)
i've let you go, so get away from me
gimme my space back, you gotta just (go)
everything comes down to memories of (you)
i've kept it in, but now i'm letting you (know)
i've let you go!
and now, you've become a part of me
(you'll always be right here)
you've become a part of me
(you'll always be my fear)
i can't separate
(myself from what i've done)
giving up a part of me
i've let myself become you
i've let myself become you
i've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
giving up a part of me
i've let myself become you
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
there's a place so dark, you can't see the end
skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
the rain then sends dripping acidic questions
forcefully, the power of suggestion
then with the eyes shut, looking through the rust and rot
and dust, a small spot of light floods the floor
and pours over the rusted world of pretend
and the eyes ease open and it's dark again
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
in the memory, you'll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up
moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
pollution manifested in perpetual sound
the wheels go round and the sunset creeps
behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
a little piece of paper with a picture drawn
floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
and the memory now is like the picture was then
when the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
in the memory, you'll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
in the memory, you'll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up
in the memory, you will find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up
come, come, come
come, coming at you...
come, coming at you...
come, coming at you...
yo...
peep the style and the kids checking for it
the number one question is: how could you ignore it?
we drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
with raps that got you backing this up like "rewind that"
we're just rolling with the rhythm
rise from the ashes of stylistic division
with these non-stop lyrics of life living
not to be forgotten, but still unforgiven
but in the meantime, there are those who wanna talk this and that
so i suppose that it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
and get dirty with the people spreading the dirt
it goes:
try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
i got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
and everything left's a waste of time
i hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more
i'm riding on the back of this pressure
guessing that it's better i can't keep myself together
because all of this stress gave me something to write on
the pain gave me something i could set my sights on
you never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
the uphill struggle over years, the fear
and trash-talking and the people it was to
and the people that started it, just like you
try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
i got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
nothing to gain, everything to fear
heart full of pain, head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
nothing to gain, everything to fear
heart full of pain
try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
i got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
nobody's listening
handful of anger held in my chest
nobody's listening
uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
nobody's listening
nothing to gain, everything to fear
nobody's listening
come, come, come, come, coming at you...
come, coming, come, come, coming at you...
come, coming, come, come, coming at...
come, come, come, come
coming at you from every side
i've lied to you
the same way that i always do
this is the last smile
that i'll fake for the sake of being with you
everything falls apart, even the people
who never frown eventually break down
the sacrifice of hiding in a lie
everything has to end, you'll soon find
we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
the sacrifice is never knowing
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
i've tried, like you
to do everything you wanted to
this is the last time
i'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
everything falls apart, even the people
who never frown eventually break down
the sacrifice of hiding in a lie
everything has to end, you'll soon find
we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
the sacrifice is never knowing
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
we're all out of time
this is how we find how it all unwinds
the sacrifice of hiding in a lie
we're all out of time
this is how we find how it all unwinds
the sacrifice is never knowing
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
a constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
the lessons that you taught me, i learned were never true
now i find myself in question
they point the finger at me again
guilty by association
you point the finger at me again
i wanna run away, never say goodbye
i wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
i wanna know the answers, no more lies
i wanna shut the door and open up my mind
paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
another wave of tension has more than filled me up
all my talk of taking action, these words were never true
now i find myself in question
they point the finger at me again
guilty by association
you point the finger at me again
i wanna run away, never say goodbye
i wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
i wanna know the answers, no more lies
i wanna shut the door and open up my mind
i'm gonna run away and never say goodbye
gonna run away, gonna run away
gonna run away, gonna run away
i'm gonna run away and never wonder why
gonna run away, gonna run away
gonna run away, gonna run away
i'm gonna run away and open up my mind
gonna run away, gonna run away
mind (gonna run away, gonna run away)
mind (gonna run away, gonna run away)
mind (gonna run away, gonna run away)
i wanna run away, never say goodbye
i wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
i wanna know the answers, no more lies
i wanna shut the door and open up my mind
i wanna run away and open up my mind
i wanna run away and open up my mind
i wanna run away and open up my mind
i wanna run away and open up my mind
sometimes i need to remember just to breathe
sometimes i need you to stay away from me
sometimes i'm in disbelief i didn't know
somehow, i need you to go
don't stay (forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
what you were changing me into (just give me myself back and) don't stay
(forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
take all your faithlessness with you (just give me myself back and) don't stay
sometimes i feel like i trusted you too well
sometimes i just feel like screaming at myself
sometimes i'm in disbelief i didn't know
somehow, i need to be alone
don't stay (forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
what you were changing me into (just give me myself back and) don't stay
(forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
take all your faithlessness with you (just give me myself back and) don't stay
i don't need you anymore
i don't want to be ignored
i don't need one more day of you wasting me away
i don't need you anymore
i don't want to be ignored
i don't need one more day of you wasting me away
with no apologies
don't stay (forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
what you were changing me into (just give me myself back and) don't stay
(forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
take all your faithlessness with you (just give me myself back and) don't stay
don't stay
don't stay
yeah
i am not a pattern to be followed
the pill that i'm on is a tough one to swallow
i'm not a criminal, not a role model
not a born leader, i'm a tough act to follow
i am not the fortune and the fame
nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game
i came in the ring like a dog on a chain
and i found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
and it seems ugly, but it can get worse
'cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
and i'm not a robot, i'm not a monkey
i will not dance, even if the beat's funky
opposite of lazy far from a punk
you all ought to stop talking
start trying to catch up, motherfucker!
and all the people say
try to catch up motherfucker!
lauryn said money change a situation
big said it increase the complication
kane said "don't step. i ain't the one."
chuck said that uzi weigh a motherfucking ton
and i'm just a student of the game that they taught me
rocking every stage in every place that it brought me
i'm awfully underrated
but came here to correct it
and so it ain't mistaken, i'ma state it for the record
i am
the opposite of wack
opposite of weak
opposite of slack
synonym of heat
synonym of crack
closest to a peak
far from a punk
you all ought to stop talking
start trying to catch up, motherfucker!
and all the people say
try to catch up motherfucker!
oh, when they come for me
come for me, i'll be gone
oh, when they come for me
come for me, i'll be gone
oh, when they come for me
come for me, i'll be gone
and all the people say
try to catch up motherfucker!
and all the people say
try to catch up motherfucker!

this is my december
this is my time of the year
this is my december
this is all so clear
this is my december
this is my snow-covered home
this is my december
this is me, alone
(and i) just wish that i didn't feel
like there was something i missed
(and i) take back all the things i said
to make you feel like that
(and i) just wish that i didn't feel
like there was something i missed
(and i) take back all the things
that i said to you
and i'd give it all away
just to have somewhere to go to
give it all away
to have someone to come home to
this is my december
these are my snow-covered dreams
this is me pretending
this is all i need
(and i) just wish that i didn't feel
like there was something i missed
(and i) take back all the things i said
to make you feel like that
(and i) just wish that i didn't feel

give it all away
just to have somewhere to go to

give it all away
to have someone to come home to
i used the deadwood to make the fire rise
the blood of innocence burning in the skies
i filled my cup with the rising of the sea
and poured it out in an ocean of debris
i'm swimming in the smoke
of bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve
we held our breath when the clouds began to form
but you were lost in the beating of the storm
and in the end, we were made to be apart
like separate chambers of the human heart
i'm swimming in the smoke
of bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
it's in the blackened bones
of bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve
i'm swimming in the smoke
of bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
the blame is mine, alone
for bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve, oh
what i don't deserve
i use the deadwood to make the fire rise
the blood of innocence burning in the skies
water grey
through the windows, up the stairs
chilling rain
like an ocean, everywhere
don't want to reach for me, do you?
i mean nothing to you
the little things give you away
and now there will be no mistaking
the levees are breaking
all you've ever wanted
was someone to truly look up to you
and six feet underwater, i do
hope decays
generations disappear
washed away
as a nation simply stares
don't want to reach for me, do you?
i mean nothing to you
the little things give you away
and now there will be no mistaking
the levees are breaking
all you've ever wanted
was someone to truly look up to you
and six feet underwater, i do
all you've ever wanted

tell us all again what you think we should be
what the answers are, what it is we can't see
tell us all again how to do what you say
how to fall in line, how there's no other way
but oh, we all know
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
you're guilty all the same
show us all again, that our hands are unclean
that we're unprepared, that you have what we need
show us all again 'cause we cannot be saved
'cause the end is near, now there's no other way
and oh, you will know
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
there's no one else to blame
guilty all the same
guilty all the same
you're guilty all the same
yeah, you already know what it is
can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
when a man has plans of being rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
it's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
they talk team and take the paper route
all they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
at anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
no regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
the smoke screen before the flame
knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
they say it's time for things to change
rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
it's real deep until no more remains, but i'm still me
like authentic hip-hop and rock
till pop and radio and record companies killed me
try to force me to stray and obey
and got the gall to say how real can real be?
you feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
tv or a name, the media, the game, to me you're all the same
you're guilty
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
there's no one else to blame
guilty all the same
guilty all the same
guilty all the same
there's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
you can't even passively take part
and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
and you've got to make it stop
to save face, how low can you go
talk a lot of game but yet you don't know
static on the way, make us all say whoa
the people up top push the people down low
get down
and obey every word
steady getting mine if you haven't yet heard
wanna take what i got, don't be absurd
don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
if you haven't heard yet then i'm letting you know
there ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
and no one make a move unless my people say so
got everything outta control
now everybody go
steel unload, final blow
we the animals, take control
hear us now, clear and true
wretches and kings we come for you
so keep pace, how slow can you go
talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know
fire on the way, make you all say whoa
the people up top and the people down low
get down
and i'm running it like that
the front of the attack is exactly where i'm at
somewhere in-between, the kick and the hi-hat
the pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
so get with the combat, i'm letting 'em know
there ain't shit you can say to make me back down no
so push the button let the whole thing blow
spinning everything outta control
now everybody go
steel unload, final blow
we the animals, take control
hear us now, clear and true
wretches and kings we come for you
steel unload, fire blow
filthy animals, beat them low
skin and bone, black and blue
no more this sun shall beat onto you
from the front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
you can't even passively take part
and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
and you've got to make it stop
and you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it
that unless you're free
the machine will be prevented from working at all
there are just too many
times that people
have tried to look inside of me
wondering what i think of you
and i protect you out of courtesy
too many times that i’ve
held on when i needed to push away
afraid to say what was on my mind
afraid to say what i need to say
too many things that you’ve said about me when i’m not around
you think having the upper hand
means you gotta keep puttin' me down
but i’ve had too many stand-offs with you
it’s about as much as i can stand
so i'm waiting until the upper hand is mine
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
watch it drop)
making your heart stop
(just before you hit the floor)
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
missed your shot)
making your heart stop
(you think you won)
and then it's all gone
so many people like me
put so much trust in all your lies
so concerned with what you think
to just say what we feel inside
so many people like me
walk on eggshells all day long
all i know is that all i want
is to feel like i’m not stepped on
there are so many things you say
that make me feel you crossed the line
what goes up will surely fall
and i’m counting down the time
'cause i’ve had so many stand-offs with you
it’s about as much as i can stand
so i’m waiting until the upper hand is mine
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
watch it drop)
making your heart stop
(just before you hit the floor)
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
missed your shot)
making your heart stop
(you think you won)
and then it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
now it's all gone
i know i’ll never trust a single thing you say
you knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
and all the lies have got you floating up above us all
but what goes up has got to fall
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
watch it drop)
making your heart stop
(just before you hit the floor)
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
missed your shot)
making your heart stop
(you think you won)
and then it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
now it's all gone
i'm stuck in this bed you made
alone with a sinking feeling
i saw through the words you said
to the secrets you've been keeping
it's written upon your face
all the lies, how they cut so deeply
you can't get enough, you take
and take and take and never say
no! you've gotta get it inside!
you push it back down! you push it back down!
no! you'll never get it inside!
push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!
you say that it's not your fault
and swear that i am mistaken
you said it's not what it seems
no remorse for the trust you're breaking
you run but then back, you fall
suffocate in the mess you're making
you can't get enough you take
and take and take and take and take
fuck it, are you listening?
no! you've gotta get it inside!
you push it back down! you push it back down!
no! you'll never get it inside!
push it back down! you push it back down!
no! you've gotta get it inside!
you push it back down! you push it back down!
no! you'll never get it inside!
push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
you push it back down! push it back down!
you push it back down, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
floating down, as colors fill the light
we look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
and floating up, you pass us in the night
a future gazing out, a past to overwrite
so, come down, far below
we've been waiting to collect the things you know
come down, far below
we've been waiting to collect what you've let go
come down, oh
come down, oh
come down, oh
come down, oh
come down, oh
my insides all turned to ash, so slow
and blew away as i collapsed, so cold
a black wind took them away from sight
and held the darkness over day, that night
and the clouds above move closer
looking so dissatisfied
but the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
i used to be my own protection, but not now
'cause my path has lost direction, somehow
a black wind took you away from sight
and held the darkness over day, that night
and the clouds above move closer
looking so dissatisfied
and the ground below grew colder
as they put you down inside
but the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
so now, you're gone and i was wrong
i never knew what it was like to be alone
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
(i used to be my own protection, but not now)
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
('cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
(i used to be my own protection, but not now)
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
('cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
separate
sifting through the wreckage, i can't concentrate
searching for a message in that fear and pain
broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive
now, in my remains
are promises that never came
set this silence free
to wash away the worst of me
come apart
falling in the cracks of every broken heart
digging through the wreckage of your disregard
sinking down and waiting for the chance to feel alive
now, in my remains
are promises that never came
set this silence free
to wash away the worst of me
like an army falling one by one by one
like an army falling one by one by one
like an army falling one by one by one
like an army falling one by one by one
now, in my remains (one by one, one by one)
are promises that never came (one by one by one)
set this silence free (one by one, one by one)
to wash away the worst of me (one by one by one)
like an army falling (one by one, one by one)
one by one by one (one by one by one)
like an army falling (one by one, one by one)
one by one by one
you hid your skeletons when i had shown you mine
you woke the devil that i thought you'd left behind
i saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose
and you held it all
but you were careless to let it fall
you held it all
and i was by your side, powerless
i watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
i'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend
you'll never know what i became because of you
ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose
and you held it all
but you were careless to let it fall
you held it all
and i was by your side, powerless
 (x2)
oh, oh-oh
oh
oh, oh-oh
oh
and you held it all
but you were careless to let it fall
you held it all
and i was by your side, powerless
powerless, powerless
a fire needs a space to burn
a breath to build a glow
i've heard it said a thousand times
but now i know
that you don't know what you've got
oh, you don't know what you've got
no, you don't know what you've got
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
i thought i kept you safe and sound
i thought i made you strong
but something made me realize
that i was wrong
'cause finding what you've got sometimes
means finding it alone
and i can finally see your light
when i let go
'cause you don't know what you've got
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
'cause you don't know what you've got
oh, you don't know what you've got
no, you don't know what you've got
it's your battle to be fought
no, you don't know what you've got
till it's gone
till it's gone
till it's gone
.
yeah
uh
so what'cha waiting for, anticipating more
while you debate what it could take to instigate a war?
yeah, i been hated more than time i wasn't hated for
there's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before
but you could never see it, your battle's not mine
wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time
while you're waiting for a purpose, i already got mine
while you tell me step to it like "one, two, three, four"
and if i do what you demand
(you say!) you'll let me understand
(you say!) you're gonna hold me to your word
and if i sell myself away
(you say!) i'll have no debt to pay
(you say!) i'm gonna get what i deserve
your word, obeyed
my debt, repaid
our trust, betrayed
all for nothing! all for nothing!
kick back, there's no other way to say it
so let me break this fucker down for you, i really don't know you
you talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia
you're joking, i don't have a half a sucker bone to throw you
i'm disgusted
wonder what could've made you tuck your tail below you
and no, i'm not your soldier, i'm not taking any orders
i'm a five-star general infantry controller
need a lesson? let me show you
have you checking your composure
while i make you step to it like "one, two, three, four"?
and if i do what you demand
(you say!) you'll let me understand
(you say!) you're gonna hold me to your word
and if i sell myself away
(you say!) i'll have no debt to pay
(you say!) i'm gonna get what i deserve
and if i do what you demand
you'll let me understand
your word, obeyed
my debt, repaid
our trust, betrayed
all for nothing! all for nothing!
all for nothing! all for nothing!
 “we're (going?) too far”
 “i don't think we're too far”
 “we are”
 “there's a difference. put the heavy shit there”
 “the heavy shit right here?”
are you lost in your lies?
do you tell yourself i don't realize
your crusade's a disguise
replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives
i'm aware of what you've done
no, no more sorrow
i've paid for your mistakes
your time is borrowed
your time has come to be replaced
i see pain, i see need
i see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
i had hope, i believed
but i'm beginning to think that i've been deceived
you will pay for what you've done
no, no more sorrow
i've paid for your mistakes
your time is borrowed
your time has come to be replaced
thieves and hypocrites
thieves and hypocrites
thieves and hypocrites
no, no more sorrow
i've paid for your mistakes
your time is borrowed
your time has come to be replaced
no, no more sorrow
i've paid for your mistakes
your time is borrowed
your time has come to be replaced
your time has come to be replaced
your time has come to be erased
telling me to go
but hands beg me to stay
your lips say that you love
your eyes say that you hate
there's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
what you build, you lay to waste
there's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
all i've got's what you didn't take
so i, i won't be the one
be the one to leave this in pieces
and you, you will be alone
alone with all your secrets and regrets
don't lie
you promise me the sky
then toss me like a stone
you wrap me in your arms
then chill me to the bone
there's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
all i've got's what you didn't take
so i, i won't be the one
be the one to leave this in pieces
and you, you will be alone
alone with all your secrets and regrets
don't lie
so i, i won't be the one
be the one to leave this in pieces
and you, you will be alone
alone with all your secrets and regrets
don't lie
no control, no surprise
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
i'm my own casualty
i fuck up everything i see, fighting in futility
we start the final war, tell me what's worth fighting for
when we know there's nothing more
we take the hand or fist just to sell ourselves for this
the path we least resist
no control, no surprise
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
i'm my own casualty
i fuck up everything i see, fighting in futility
i give you what you came for, this is not the same though
got a different method, but i still can bring the pain, so
y'all all get that same flow, i got that insane flow
high as y'all can get, you're never really in my range though
yes, i'm half anglo, half-fried panko
all prime-time rhymer, let the bass bang low
all you fucking lames go aiming at my name, know
careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
no control, no surprise
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
i'm my own casualty
i fuck up everything i see, fighting in futility
no control, no surprise
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
i'm my own casualty
i'm my own casualty
"i'm not allowed to say certain things! ahh!"
try and do... try and do the other thing, real quick
it goes a one, two, three
i was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
i don't need to sweat it when a competition come
original style like an 808 drum
so i don't run the track, no, i make the track run
my mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
i put 'em both together, now tell me what i got
it's a pretty smart weapon, i can shoot it, i can drop it
but learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it
like that
it ain't over 'cause the
shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
and anything you do they wanna get a little bite
it really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'cause once they get their teeth in, nothing really fights
and as for me, i do it like i got nothing to lose
and you can run your mouth like you can try to fill my shoes
but steady little soldier, i ain't standing next to you
i'd be laying on the ground before you're even in my view
like that
give me the strength of the rising sun
give me the truth of the words unsung
and when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
"bring me to kingdom come"
it's something for your people on the block
to black out and rock to
give me what you need like poppa, who shot you?
"separate the weak from the obsolete"
you're meek, i creep hard on impostors
and switch styles on a dime, quick-witted
y'all quit tripping, i don't have time for your crying
i grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup?
bang, bang, little monkey man playing with the big guns
only get you slain, i ain't playing, i'm just saying
you ain't got a sliver of a chance
i get iller, i deliver while you quiver in your pants
so shake, shake down, money, here's the breakdown
you can play the bank, i'mma play the bank takedown
and no mistakes now, i'm coming to get you
i'm just a banksy, you're a brainwash
get the picture?
it's like that
we swim against the rising waves
and crash against the shore
the body bends until it breaks
the early morning sings no more
so rest your head, it's time to sleep
and dream of what's in store
the body bends until it breaks
and sings again no more
'cause time has torn the flesh away
the early morning sings no more
today, we stood on the wall
we laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
we laughed at it all
and when they, they told us to go
we paid them no mind like every other time
but little did we know
today, i looked for a sign
with flames in my hands
a line in the sand between yours and mine
and it came like fire from below
your greed led the call, my flag had to fall
but little did you know
another day, your truth will come
you're gonna pay for what you've
pay for what you've done
you'll get what's yours and face your crime
you'll tell them, "give me back what's mine"
"give me back what's mine!"
i'd never been a coward, i'd never seen blood
you'd sold me an ocean, and i was lost in the flood
we were counting on a leader, we were driven by need
but couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed
you were steady as a sniper, we were waiting on a wire
so we never saw it coming when you ran from the fire
you can try intimidation and you can try to ignore
but when the time comes calling, yeah, you are gonna get yours
another day, your truth will come
you're gonna pay for what you've
pay for what you've done
you'll get what's yours and face your crime
you'll tell them "give me back what's mine"
"give me back what's mine!"
and so today, your truth has come
you're gonna pay for what you've
pay for what you've done
you'll get what's yours, you're out of time
and you will give me back what's mine
give me back what's mine!
give me, give me back what's mine!
give me, give me back what's mine!
what's mine!
give me, give me back what's mine!
what's mine! what's mine!
give me back what's mine!
today, we stood on the wall
we laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
we laughed at it all
and when they, they told us to go
we paid them no mind like every other time
but little did we know
i've seen the blood, i've seen the broken
the lost and the sights unseen
i want a flood, i want an ocean
to wash my confusion clean
i can't resolve this empty story
i can't repair the damage done
we are the fortunate ones
who've never faced oppression's gun
we are the fortunate ones
imitations of rebellion
we acted out, we wear the colors
confined by the things we own
we're not without, we're like each other
pretending we're here alone
and far away they burn their buildings
right in the face of the damage done
we are the fortunate ones
who've never faced oppression's gun
we are the fortunate ones
imitations of rebellion
rebellion
rebellion
rebellion
rebellion, rebellion
we lost before the start
rebellion, rebellion
one by one, we fall apart
we fall apart
we fall apart
we fall apart
we are the fortunate ones
who've never faced oppression's gun
we are the fortunate ones
imitations of, imitations of...
we are the fortunate ones
who've never faced oppression's gun
we are the fortunate ones
imitations of rebellion
rebellion
rebellion
rebellion
let me apologize to begin with
let me apologize for what i'm about to say
but trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed
and somehow, i got caught up in between
let me apologize to begin with
let me apologize for what i'm about to say
but trying to be someone else was harder than it seemed
and somehow, i got caught up in between
between my pride and my promise
between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
the things i want to say to you get lost before they come
the only thing that's worse than one is none
let me apologize to begin with
let me apologize for what i'm about to say
but trying to regain your trust was harder than it seemed
and somehow, i got caught up in between
between my pride and my promise
between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
the things i want to say to you get lost before they come
the only thing that's worse than one is none
the only thing that's worse than one is none
and i cannot explain to you
in anything i say or do or plan
fear is not afraid of you
guilt's a language you can understand
i cannot explain to you, in anything i say or do
i hope the actions speak the words they can
for my pride and my promise
for my lies and how the truth gets in the way
the things i want to say to you get lost before they come
the only thing that's worse than one is...
pride and my promise

the only thing that's worse than one is none

this is war with no weapons, marching with no stepping
murder with no killing, illing every direction
first, no sequel, do the math, no equal
john with no yoko; more power, less people
and no, i'm not afraid of that, print it in your paperback
every rap is made in fact to act as a delayed attack
every phrase a razor blade that's saved until they play it back
to slay and leave 'em laying on the pavement, bang, fade to black
in the wastelands of today
when there's nothing left to lose
and there's nothing more to take
but you force yourself to choose
in the wastelands of today
where tomorrow disappears
while the future slips away
and your hope turns into fear
in the wastelands of today
roll credits, you get it, the show is done
they're talking for just talking, but meaning, they got none
none of 'em come proper, they talk like a shotgun
but how many got bred with integrity? not one
so no, i'm not afraid to see you suckers hold a blade to me
ain't no way to shake the ground i built before you came to be
take it how you take it, i'm the opposite of vacancy
and this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see
in the wastelands of today
when there's nothing left to lose
and there's nothing more to take
but you force yourself to choose
in the wastelands of today
where tomorrow disappears
while the future slips away
and your hope turns into fear
and your hope turns into fear
in the wastelands of today
in the wastelands of today
when there's nothing left to lose
and there's nothing more to take
but you force yourself to choose
in the wastelands of today
where tomorrow disappears
while the future slips away
and your hope turns into fear
and your hope turns into fear
in the wastelands of today
in the wastelands of today
in the wastelands of today
like shining oil, this night is dripping down
stars are slipping down, glistening
and i'm trying not to think what i'm leaving, now
no deceiving now, it's time you let me know
let me know
when the lights go out and we open our eyes
out there in the silence, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
this air between us is getting thinner now
into winter now, bittersweet
and 'cross that horizon, this sun is setting down
you're forgetting now, it's time you let me go
let me go
when the lights go out and we open our eyes
out there in the silence, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
and tell them i couldn't help myself
and tell them i was alone
oh, tell me i am the only one
and there's nothing left to stop me
when the lights go out and we open our eyes
out there in the silence, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow, i'll be gone, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
you say you're not gonna fight
'cause no one will fight for you
and you think there's not enough love
and no one to give it to
and you're sure you've hurt for so long
you've got nothing left to lose
so, you say you're not gonna fight
'cause no one will fight for you
you say the weight of the world
has kept you from letting go
and you think compassion's a flaw
and you'll never let it show
and you're sure you've hurt in a way
that no one will ever know
but someday, the weight of the world
will give you the strength to go
whoa-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh
da-yeah-nah, no-ooh-oh
no, no
hold on, the weight of the world (na, no, no, no, no oh)
(oh-ho, yeah, yeah, yeah)
will give you the strength to go (yeah, yeah, aah)
(yeah, no)
so hold on, the weight of the world (yeah-aah, yeah, yeah)
will give you the strength to go (nah, ha, ha, ha) (no-oh, no-oh)
(ha ha ha ha, yah, yah, yah) (no-oh, no-oh)
(no-oh)
so hold on, the weight of the world (ah, yeah)
will give you the strength to go (mah, mah, mah)
(oh god, oh god, oh god)
just hold on, the weight of the world
will give you the strength to go
i come to this magnificent house of worship tonight
because my conscience leaves me no other choice
a true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order
and say of war;
"this way of settling differences is not just
this business of burning human beings with napalm
of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows
of injecting poisonous drugs of hate
into the veins of peoples normally humane
of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields
physically handicapped and psychologically deranged
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"

i'mma be that nail in your coffin
saying that i softened, i was ducking down to reload
so you can save your petty explanations
i don't have the patience; before you even say it, i know
you let your pride or your ego talk slick to me, no
that is not the way i get down
and look at how you lose your composure
now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds
i want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
what is it you want me to tell you?
i'm not the failure, i would rather live and let be
but you came with the right kind of threat to
push me to let you know you can't intimidate me
you disrespect me so clearly, now you better hear me
that is not the way it goes down
you did it to yourself and it's over
now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds
i want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
you did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
you did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
you did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
you did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
i want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
drop like "get up", take to the streets
better lock that kid up, face full of teeth
when he hock that spit up, pacing the beat like a beast
rocking the block on repeat
speak from the cut like a rush of blood
paint red on the sleeves of the ones you love
lay the sick ones down and the bells will ring
put pennies on the eyes, let the dead men sing
i shiver and shake the warm air cold
i'm alone on my own
in every mistake, i dig this hole
through my skin and bones
it’s harder starting over
than never to have changed
with blackbirds following me
i'm digging out my grave
they close in, swallowing me
the pain, it comes in waves
i'm getting back what i gave
i sweat through the sheet as daylight fades
as i waste away
it traps me inside mistakes i've made
that's the price i pay
it’s harder starting over
than never to have changed
with blackbirds following me
i'm digging out my grave
they close in, swallowing me
the pain, it comes in waves
i'm getting back what i gave
i drop to the floor like i did before
stop watching, i'm coughing, i can't be more
what i want and what i need are at constant war
like a well full of poison, a rotten core
the blood goes thin, the fever stings
and i shake from the hell that the habits bring
let the sick ones down, the bells will ring
put pennies on the eyes, let the dead men sing
blackbirds following me
i'm digging out my grave
they close in, swallowing me
the pain, it comes in waves
i'm getting back what i gave
i'm getting back what i gave
i'm getting back what i gave
folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight
i'd like to introduce...
mr. hahn
let's hear it for the great (mr. hahn)
and now for a lesson in rhythm management
let's begin
alright now, wasn't that fun?
let's try something else
skin to bone, steel to rust
ash to ashes, dust to dust
let tomorrow have its way
with the promises we made
skin to bone, steel to rust
ash to ashes, dust to dust
your deception, my disgust
when your name is finally drawn
i'll be happy that you're gone
ash to ashes, dust to dust
ah, ash to ashes, dust to dust
ah, skin to bone and steel to rust
right to left, left to right
night to day and day to night
as the starlight fades to grey
i'll be marching far away
right to left and left to right
ah, ash to ashes, dust to dust
ah, skin to bone and steel to rust
let tomorrow have its way
with the promises betrayed
skin to bone and steel to rust
skin to bone and steel to rust
skin to bone and steel to rust
one, two
one, two, thank you
there's no peace, only war
victory decides who's wrong or right
it will not cease, only grow
you better be prepared to fight
and it will not apologize
for laying down your life
war
there's no pain, it will spare
fear has become your only right
and once you're lost, in your despair
forever black eternal night
and it will not apologize
for laying down your life
war, destroyer
war, destroyer
it needs no side to justify
laying down your life
war, destroyer
war

i've seen her smiling
the sunlight shining on her now
she couldn't stay here
she knows you won't let her down
you know she couldn't stay here with you
you know she had to go
even though she couldn't stay here with you
you know you're not alone
no matter what you think you did wrong
(won't be long 'til everybody knows)

the sunlight's crying for her now
she wouldn't stay here
she knows you won't let her down
you know she couldn't stay here with you
you know she had to go
even though she couldn't stay here with you
you know you're not alone
no matter what you think you did wrong
(won't be long 'til everybody knows)

there's a fragile game we play
with the ghosts of yesterday
if we can't let go, we'll never say goodbye
no trace of what remains
no stones to mark the graves
only memories we thought we could deny
there was so much more to lose
than the pain i put you through
in my carelessness, i left you in the dark
and the blood may wash away
but the scars will never fade
at least i know, somehow, i made a mark
in the dark, in the light
nothing left, nothing right
in the dark, in the light
nothing left, nothing right
in the dark, in the light
nothing left, nothing right
in the dark, in the light
nothing left, nothing right!
nothing right!
nothing right!
we knew the world would not be the same
few people laughed, few people cried, most people were silent
i remember the line from the hindu scripture, the bhagavad-gita
vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says:
"now i am become death, the destroyer of worlds"
i suppose we all thought that, one way or another
no regret for the confidence betrayed
no more hiding in shadow
'cause i won't wait for the debt to be repaid
time has come for you
victimized, victimized
never again victimized
victimized, victimized
never again victimized
they're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot i'll give 'em
as the siren climbs higher on this violent rhythm
for you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
i ain't scared of your teeth, i admire what's in 'em
you been waiting in the shadows there, thinking you're hidden
but the truth is, you don't have the stomach to get 'em
go on already, hit 'em, yeah, you gotta be kidding
wanna talk about a victim? i'mma put you there with 'em
victimized, victimized
never again victimized
victimized, victimized
never again victimized
no
just do something to tell you who i am, you know?

i've been digging into crates ever since i was living in space
before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
mastered numerology and big bang theology
performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
invented the mic so i could start blessing it
and chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
many men have tried to shake us
but i twist mic chords to double helixes
and show them what i'm made of
i buckle knees like leg braces
cast the spell of instrumentalness on all of the mc's that hate us
so try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
from now to infinity, let icons be bygones
i firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
i tried threats, but moved on to a promise
i stomp shit, with or without an accomplice

put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
never satisfy my rhyme jones
spraying bright day over what you might say
blood type krylon, technicolor type a
on highways, bright with road rage
i'm patient to win, the cage and the tin to bounce all around
in surround sound, devouring the scene
subliminal gangrene paintings, overall, the same thing
sing-song karaoke copy madness
break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
fourth dimension combat convention
write rhymes at ease while the tracks stands at attention
(attention!)
meant to put you away with the pencil pistol, official
sixteen-line, rhyme missile
while you risk your all, i pick out of your flaws

your lies!
yeah!
i didn't think that i had a debt to pay
'til they came to take all i had left away
you said you wouldn't put me to the test today
but i remember you saying that yesterday
there was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole
another lie hard to follow 'til it followed you home
and like that
broken down
a victim of your lies
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you crossed the line
wrapped up inside your lies
you hide behind lies
you're lost inside that cold disguise
behind your lies
i don't know what you thought i might say
seems like we never would talk the right way
every other minute i fought for my place
and drop what i made thought and you might stay so
i'm guessing that you probably know
when your inside's hollow then you ought to be cold
like a pill i couldn't swallow and it swallowed me whole
another lie hard to follow 'til it followed me home
and like that
broken down
a victim of your lies
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you crossed the line
wrapped up inside your lies
you hide behind lies
you're lost inside that cold disguise
behind your lies
you're faking, you're mistaken
if you think that you could climb out of this hole
forsaken, what we take when
all our lies come from the power of control
broken down
a victim of your lies
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you hide behind
wrapped up inside your lies
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you crossed the line
wrapped up inside your lies
you hide behind lies
you're lost inside that cold disguise
behind your lies
standing alone with no direction
how did i fall so far behind?
why am i searching for perfection
knowing it's something i won't find?
in my fear and flaws
i let myself down, again
all because
i run 'til the silence splits me open
i run 'til it puts me underground
'til i have no breath
and no roads left but one
when did i lose my sense of purpose?
can i regain what's lost inside?
why do i feel like i deserve this?
why does my pain look like my pride?
in my fear and flaws
i let myself down, again
all because i let myself down
in my fear and flaws
i run 'til the silence splits me open
i run 'til it puts me underground
'til i have no breath
and no roads left but one
no roads left but one
in my fear and flaws
i let myself down, again
all because
i run and the silence splits me open
i run and it puts me underground
but there's no regret
and no roads left to run
yo...
watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
mixed media slang banging in your boom box
verbal violence, lyrical stylist
in a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish
you can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
rapping to a beat doesn't make you an mc
with your lack of skill and facility, you're killing me
and a dj in the group just for credibility
i heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
you're not an mc if someone else writes your lines
rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
‘cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years
but now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
all after a fast buck, and all the tracks suck
so how does it stack up? none of it's real
you want to be an mc, you've got to study the skill
who can rock a rhyme like this?
bring it to you every time like this?
who can rock a rhyme like this?
step, step up! step, step up!
so, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
but mentally, you don't have the hip hop energy
with a tendency to make up stories (bullshit)
sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40
and your record company is completely missing it
all the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
so in a battle, you can't hack it, react with whack shit
and get smacked with verbal back flips
get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
it's taken decades for mc's to establish this
you're new to hip-hop, and welcome if your serious
but not on the mic, leave that to the experienced
using the waves of sound
the true master paralyzes his opponents
leaving him vulnerable to attack
who can rock a rhyme like this?
bring it to you every time like this?
who can rock a rhyme like this?
step, step up! step, step up!
after years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists
we here at the sound institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system
actual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body
and the question must be asked…
who can rock a rhyme like this?
bring it to you every time like this?
who can rock a rhyme like this?
step, step up! step, step up!
who can rock a rhyme like this?
bring it to you every time like this?
who can rock a rhyme like this?

in this desert, in darkness
lying with the gun across his chest
pretending he's heartless
as the fire flashes in the sky
he was fragile and frozen
when the bullet took away his friend
and now he's somehow more broken
he's pulling his weapon to his side
loading it full of his goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
he's pulling his weapon to his side
loading it full of his goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
sweating and shaking
lying with her hands across her chest
she wakes with her cravings
as the fire flashes in her eye
she was fragile and frozen
when the needle took away her friend
but now she's somehow more broken
she's pulling her weapon to her side
loading it full of her goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
she's pulling her weapon to her side
loading it full of her goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
with every battle he's chosing
with every fight he's losing
his enemy's not far behind
with every promise she's broken
with every lie she's spoken
her enemy's not far behind
it's your time
it's your time
it's your time
it's your time!
he's pulling his weapon to his side
loading it full of his goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
she's pulling her weapon to her side

i'm swimming in the smoke
of bridges i have burned
so, don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
the blame is mine, alone
for bridges i have burned
so, don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve
"todos los pelotones, presten atención ahora mismo!"
i break down, fear is sinking in
the cold comes, racing through my skin
searching for a way to get to you through the storm
you go, giving up your home
go, leaving all you’ve known, you are not alone
with arms up, stretched into the sky
with eyes like echoes in the night
hiding from the hell that you’ve been through, silent one
you go, giving up your home
go, leaving all you’ve known
you go, giving up your home
go, leaving all you’ve known, you are not alone
you go, giving up your home
go, leaving all you’ve known
you go, giving up your home
go, you are not unknown, you are not alone
you are not unknown, you are not alone
where should i start? disjointed heart
i've got no commitment to my own flesh and blood
left all alone, far from my home
no one to hear me, to heal my ill heart
i keep it locked up, inside
i cannot express to the point i've regressed
if anger's a gift, then i guess i've been blessed
i keep it locked up, inside
keep my distance from your lies
it's too late to love me, now
you have never shown me
it's too late to love me, now
you don't even know me
breaking a part of my heart to find release
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
breaking a part of my heart to find release
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
breaking a part of my heart to find release (break!)
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (me!)
breaking a part of my heart to find release (down!)
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
keep it locked up, inside
keep my distance from your lies
breaking a part of my heart to find release (break!)
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (me!)
breaking a part of my heart to find release (down!)
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
breaking a part of my heart to find release
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
breaking a part of my heart to find release
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
keep my distance
keep my distance
keep my distance
keep my distance
spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
dog paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
with my thought catalog, analogue rap battle log
keep my distance and fear resistance
hurt by persistence, the twisted web of tangled lies
strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
and i'm forced to face these hate crimes
against the state of being
feeling the weightlessness press me to the ceiling
reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
tuned to the frequency making your chest shake
with every boom
involuntary muscle contraction
ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
the sound pounds to make the dead flush
to hand you a head rush with read thoughts and said stuff
she can't hide, no matter how hard she tries
her secret disguise behind the lies
and at night, she cries away her pride
with eyes shut tight, staring at her inside
all her friends know why she can't sleep at night
all her family asking if she's alright
all she wants to do is get rid of this hell
well, all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself
she can only fool herself for so long
she can only fool herself for so long
she can only fool herself for so long
(i'm too weak to face me!) she can only fool herself
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
when it comes to how to live his life, he can't be told
says he's got it all under control
thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with
but in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit
an addict and he can't hold the reigns
the pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
tries to slow down the problem he's got
but can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop
he can only fool himself for so long
he can only fool himself for so long
he can only fool himself for so long
(i'm too weak to face me!) he can only fool himself
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
fly with me, under the wings i gave you
try to be closer to me and i'll save you
fly with me, under the wings i gave you
try to be closer to me and i'll save you
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
part of me won't go away
everyday, reminded how much i hate it
weighed it against the consequences
can't live without it, so it‘s senseless
wanna cut it out of my soul
and just live with the gaping hole
take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste
i made the problems in the first place
hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
you hardly see right next to the heart of me
hurting me, wounds soon scar
new cuts cover where the old ones are
and now i'm sick of this
i can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
i rather not even be
than the man that's staring in the mirror through me
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
i feel it everyday
i feel i made my way
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
(freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it)
once it's been dealt with
you feel like you've been touched by something angelic
and then melted down into a pool of peace
cease to be the animal you used to be
remove the broken parts you know were wrong
and feel the calm when the problem's all gone
and then you start to see another piece
of yourself that you can't let be
memories of the last fight to free yourself
taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
and now you know you can choose
to lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise
you can live if you're willing to
put a stop to just what's killing you!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
i feel it everyday
i feel i made my way
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
(alive in me, inside of me
a part of me screams away silently
alive in me, inside of me
a part of me screams away silently)
this part of me won't go away! (alive in me, inside of me)
(a part of me screams away silently)
part of me won't go away! (alive in me, inside of me)
(a part of me screams away silently)
everywhere i look around, i see how everything ought to be
every time i see myself, there's always something wrong with me
everywhere i look around, i see how everything ought to be
every time i see myself, there's always something wrong with me
i feel it everyday
i feel i made my way
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
i feel it everyday
i feel i made my way
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
 loatr
i dreamed i was missing, you were so scared
but no-one would listen, 'cause no-one else cared
after my dreaming, i woke with this fear
what am i leaving, when i'm done here?
 loatr
so, if you're asking me, i want you to know
 loatr
when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me and, when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
 sotd
i close both locks below the window
i close both blinds and turn away
sometimes solutions aren't so simple
sometimes goodbye's the only way
 sotd
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you
 sotd
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you

do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go. let it go
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
remember all the sadness and frustration

(it starts with one) one thing, i don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme
to explain in due time all i know
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (it's so unreal)
didn't look out below
watch the time go right out the window
tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
i wasted it all just to watch you go
i kept everything inside
and even though i tried, it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard
i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter
one thing, i don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind, i designed this rhyme
to remind myself how i tried so hard
in spite of the way you were mockin' me
actin' like i was part of your property
rememberin' all the times you fought with me
i'm surprised it got so far
things aren't the way they were before
you wouldn't even recognize me anymore
not that you knew me back then
but it all comes back to me in the end
you kept everything inside
and even though i tried, it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard
i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i've put my trust in you
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
there's only one thing you should know
i've put my trust in you
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
there's only one thing you should know
i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesn't even matter
i don’t like my mind right now
stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
wish that i could slow things down
i wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
and i drive myself crazy
thinking everything's about me
yeah, i drive myself crazy
'cause i can’t escape the gravity
i'm holding on
why is everything so heavy?
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around what's bringing me down
if i just let go, i'd be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy?
you say that i'm paranoid
but i’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
it’s not like i make the choice
to let my mind stay so fucking messy
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
i'm holding on
why is everything so heavy?
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around what's bringing me down
if i just let go, i'd be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy?
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
i know i'm not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning 'round me just the same
and i drive myself crazy
thinking everything’s about me
holding on
why is everything so heavy?
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around what's bringing me down
if i just let go, i'd be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy?
why is everything so heavy?
why is everything so heavy?
should've stayed, were there signs, i ignored?
can i help you, not to hurt, anymore?
we saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
there are things that we can have, but can't keep
if they say
who cares if one more light goes out?
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers, flickers
who cares when someone's time runs out?
if a moment is all we are
or quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out?
well i do
the reminders, pull the floor from your feet
in the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
and you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there
if they say
who cares if one more light goes out?
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers, flickers
who cares when someone's time runs out?
if a moment is all we are
or quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out?
well i do
(i do)
who cares if one more light goes out?
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers, flickers
who cares when someone's time runs out?
if a moment is all we are
or quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out?
well i do
well i do
i'm tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
i don't know what you're expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
can't you see that you're smothering me?
holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'cause everything that you thought i would be
has fallen apart, right in front of you
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
and every second i waste is more than i can take
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
and i know i may end up failing, too
but i know you were just like me
with someone disappointed in you
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
become so tired, so much more aware
i'm becoming this, all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
i'm tired of being what you want me to be
i've become so numb, i can't feel you there
i'm tired of being what you want me to be
i got a long way to go
and a long memory
i been searching for an answer
always just out of reach
blood on the floor
sirens repeat
i been searching for the courage
to face my enemies
when they turn down the lights
i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake
for my battle symphony
for my battle symphony
they say that i don’t belong
say that i should retreat
that i’m marching to the rhythm
of a lonesome defeat
but the sound of your voice
puts the pain in reverse
no surrender, no illusions
and for better or worse
when they turn down the lights
i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake
if i fall, get knocked down
pick myself up off the ground
if i fall, get knocked down
pick myself up off the ground
when they turn down the lights
i hear my battle symphony
all the world in front of me
if my armor breaks
i’ll fuse it back together
battle symphony
please just don’t give up on me
and my eyes are wide awake
for my battle symphony
for my battle symphony
crawling in my skin
these wounds, they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming, confusing
this lack of self-control i fear is never ending
controlling, i can't seem
to find myself again, my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence
i'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
i've felt this way before, so insecure
crawling in my skin
these wounds, they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
distracting, reacting
against my will, i stand beside my own reflection
it's haunting how i can't seem
to find myself again, my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence
i'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
i've felt this way before, so insecure
crawling in my skin
these wounds, they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing, confusing what is real
(there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming) confusing what is real
(this lack of self-control i fear is never ending
controlling) confusing what is real
so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
live from the rhythm, it's
something wild, venomous
enemies trying to read me
you're all looking highly illiterate
blindly forgetting if i'm in the mix
you won't find an equivalent
i've been here killing it
longer than you've been alive, you idiot
and it makes you so mad
somebody else could be stepping in front of you
and it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
there's more than one of you
and you can't understand the fact
that it's over and done, hope you had fun
you've got a lot to discuss on the bus
headed back where you're from
so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
good goodbye
good goodbye
good goodbye
good goodbye
(wooh!)
goodbye, good riddance
a period is after every sentence
did my time with my cellmate
maxed out so now we finished
every day was like a hail date
every night was like a hailstorm
took her back to my tinted windows
showin' out, she in rare form
wings up, now i'm airborne
king push, they got a chair for him
make way for the new queen
the old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
consequence when you ain't there for him
were you there for him?
did you care for him?
you were dead wrong
(don't you come back no more)
so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
yo
let me say goodbye to my demons
let me say goodbye to my past life
let me say goodbye to the darkness
tell 'em that i'd rather be here in the starlight
tell 'em that i'd rather be here where they love me
tell 'em that i'm yours this is our life
and i still keep raising the bar like
never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
goodbye to the stereotypes
you can't tell my kings we can't
mandem we're linking tings in parks
now i got a tune with linkin park
like goodbye to my old hoe’s
goodbye to the cold roads
i can't die for my postcode
young little mike from the gold coast
and now i'm inside with my bro bro's
gang
so say goodbye and hit the road
pack it up and disappear
you better have some place to go
'cause you can't come back around here
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
good goodbye
good goodbye
(don't you come back no more)
tell me what i've gotta do
there's no getting through to you
the lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)
you say i can't understand
but you're not giving me a chance
when you leave me, where do you go? (where do you go?)
all the walls that you keep building
all this time that i spent chasing
all the ways that i keep losing you
the truth is, you turn into someone else
you keep running like the sky is falling
i can whisper, i can yell
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
talking to myself
talking to myself
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
i admit i made mistakes
but yours might cost you everything
can't you hear me calling you home?
oh, all the walls that you keep building
all this time that i spent chasing
all the ways that i keep losing you
the truth is, you turned into someone else
you keep running like the sky is falling
i can whisper, i can yell
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
talking to myself
talking to myself
yeah i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
all the walls that you keep building
all this time that i spent chasing
all the ways that i keep losing you
the truth is, you turned into someone else
you keep running like the sky is falling
i can whisper, i can yell
but i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
i'm just talking to myself
talking to myself
talking to myself
yeah i know, yeah i know, yeah i know
talking to myself
memories consume, like opening the wound
i'm picking me apart again
you all assume i'm safe here in my room
unless i try to start again
i don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'cause inside, i realize that i'm the one confused
i don't know what's worth fighting for or why i have to scream
i don't know why i instigate and say what i don't mean
i don't know how i got this way, i know it's not alright
so, i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit tonight
clutching my cure, i tightly lock the door
i try to catch my breath again
i hurt much more than anytime before
i had no options left again
i don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'cause inside, i realize that i'm the one confused
i don't know what's worth fighting for or why i have to scream
i don't know why i instigate and say what i don't mean
i don't know how i got this way, i'll never be alright
so, i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit tonight
i'll paint it on the walls 'cause i'm the one at fault
i'll never fight again and this is how it ends
i don't know what's worth fighting for or why i have to scream
but now i have some clarity to show you what i mean
i don't know how i got this way, i'll never be alright
so, i'm breaking the habit
i'm breaking the habit
i’m breaking the habit tonight
i'm dancing with my demons
i'm hanging off the edge
storm clouds gather beneath me
waves break above my head
headfirst hallucination
i wanna fall wide awake now
you tell me it's alright
tell me i'm forgiven, tonight
but nobody can save me now
i'm holding up a light
i'm chasing out the darkness inside
'cause nobody can save me
stared into this illusion
for answers yet to come
i chose a false solution
but nobody proved me wrong
headfirst hallucination
i wanna fall wide awake
watch the ground giving way now
you tell me it's alright
tell me i'm forgiven, tonight
but nobody can save me now
i'm holding up a light
i'm chasing out the darkness inside
'cause nobody can save me
been searching somewhere out there
for what's been missing right here (i wanna fall wide awake now)
i've been searching somewhere out there
for what's been missing right here (i wanna fall wide awake now)
i wanna fall wide awake now
so tell me it's alright
tell me i'm forgiven, tonight
and only i can save me now
i'm holding up a light
chasing out the darkness inside
and i don't wanna let you down
but only i can save me!
been searching somewhere out there
for what's been missing right here
in this farewell
there's no blood, there's no alibi
'cause i've drawn regret
from the truth of a thousand lies
so let mercy come and wash away
what i've done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i've become
erase myself
and let go of what i've done
put to rest what you thought of me
while i clean this slate
with the hands of uncertainty
so let mercy come and wash away
what i've done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i've become
erase myself
and let go of what i've done
for what i've done
i start again
and whatever pain may come
today this ends
i'm forgiving what i've done
what i've done
i'll face myself
to cross out what i've become
erase myself
and let go of what i've done
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
what i've done
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
forgiving what i've done
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
(na-na na na)
take me down to the river bend
take me down to the fighting end
wash the poison from off my skin
show me how to be whole again
fly me up on a silver wing
past the black where the sirens sing
warm me up in a nova's glow
and drop me down to the dream below
'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see
bring me home in a blinding dream
through the secrets that i have seen
wash the sorrow from off my skin
and show me how to be whole again
'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there, for you to see
for you to see
'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything else i need to be
'cause i'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see, for you to see
(when this began) i had nothing to say
and i'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(i was confused) and i let it all out to find
that i'm not the only person with these things in mind
(inside of me) but all the vacancy the words revealed
is the only real thing that i've got left to feel
(nothing to lose) just stuck, hollow and alone
and the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain i've held so long
erase all the pain 'til it's gone
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
like i'm close to something real
i wanna find something i've wanted all along
somewhere i belong
and i've got nothing to say
i can't believe i didn't fall right down on my face
(i was confused) looking everywhere, only to find
that it's not the way i had imagined it all in my mind
(so what am i?) what do i have but negativity?
'cause i can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(nothing to lose) nothing to gain, hollow and alone
and the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain i've held so long
erase all the pain 'til it's gone
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
like i'm close to something real
i wanna find something i've wanted all along
somewhere i belong
i will never know myself until i do this on my own
and i will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
i will never be anything 'til i break away from me
i will break away, i'll find myself today
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain i've held so long
erase all the pain 'til it's gone
i wanna heal, i wanna feel
like i'm close to something real
i wanna find something i've wanted all along
somewhere i belong
i wanna heal
i wanna feel like i'm somewhere i belong
i wanna heal
i wanna feel like i'm somewhere i belong
somewhere i belong
i dreamed i was missing, you were so scared
but no one would listen 'cause no one else cared
after my dreaming, i woke with this fear
what am i leaving when i'm done here?
so, if you're asking me, i want you to know
when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
and don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
don't be afraid, i've taken my beating
i've shared what i made
i'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
i've never been perfect, but neither have you
so, if you're asking me, i want you to know
when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
you've learned to hide so well
pretending someone else
can come and save me from myself
i can't be who you are
when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
you've learned to hide so well
pretending someone else
can come and save me from myself
i can't be who you are
i can't be who you are
i am a little bit of loneliness
a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints, but i can't help the fact
that everyone can see these scars
i am what i want you to want
what i want you to feel
but, it's like no matter what i do
i can't convince you to just believe this is real
so, i let go, watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i'm not
but, i'll be here 'cause you're all that i got
i can't feel the way i did, before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal this damage, anymore
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
i am a little bit insecure
a little unconfident
'cause you don't understand, i do what i can
but sometimes, i don't make sense
i am what you never wanna say
but, i've never had a doubt
it's like no matter what i do, i can't convince you
for once, just to hear me out
so, i let go, watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i'm not
but, i'll be here 'cause you're all that i've got
i can't feel the way i did, before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal this damage, anymore
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
no, hear me out, now
you're gonna listen to me, like it or not
right now, hear me out, now
you're gonna listen to me, like it or not
right now
i can't feel the way i did before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
i can't feel the way i did, before
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal this damage, anymore
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
i can't feel
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
time won't heal
don't turn your back on me, i won't be ignored
why does it feel like night today?
something in here's not right today
why am i so uptight today?
paranoia's all i got left
i don't know what stressed me first
or how the pressure was fed
but i know just what it feels like
to have a voice in the back of my head
like a face that i hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time i lie
a face that laughs every time i fall
(and watches everything)
so i know that when it's time to sink or swim
that the face inside is here in me
right underneath my skin
it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
i know i've got a face in me
points out all my mistakes to me
you've got a face on the inside, too
and your paranoia's probably worse
i don't know what set me off first
but i know what i can't stand
everybody acts like the fact of the matter
is i can't add up to what you can
but everybody has a face that they hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time they lie
a face that laughs every time they fall
(and watches everything)
so you know that when it's time to sink or swim
that the face inside is watching you, too
right inside your skin
it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin
the sun goes down
i feel the light betray me
the sun goes down
i feel the light betray me
(the sun) it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
(i feel the light betray me)
(the sun) it's like i'm paranoid, looking over my back
it's like a whirlwind inside of my head
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
(i feel the light betray me)
it's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within
it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
hand grenade pins in every line
throw 'em up and let something shine
going out of my fucking mind
filthy mouth, no excuse
find a new place to hang this noose
string me up from atop these roofs
knot it tight so i won't get loose
truth is, you can stop and stare
bled myself out and no one cares
dug the trench out, laid down there
with a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
yeah, someone pour it in
make it a dirt dance floor, again
say your prayers and stomp it out
when they bring that chorus in
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out
go, stop the show
choppy words and a sloppy flow
shotgun opera, lock and load
cock it back and then watch it go
mama, help me, i've been cursed
death is rolling in every verse
candy paint on his brand new hearse
can't contain him, he knows he works
fuck, this hurts, i won't lie
doesn't matter how hard i try
half the words don't mean a thing
and i know that i won't be satisfied
so why try ignoring him?
make it a dirt dance floor again
say your prayers and stomp it out
when they bring that chorus in
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out
i've opened up these scars
i'll make you face this
i've pulled myself so far
i'll make you face this now
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away, just to throw it away
i bleed it out
i bleed it out
i bleed it out
this is not the end, this is not the beginning
just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
and though the words sound steady, something empty's within them
we say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear
waiting for the end to come
wishing i had strength to stand
this is not what i had planned
it's out of my control
flying at the speed of light
thoughts were spinning in my head
so many things were left unsaid
it's hard to let you go
i know what it takes to move on
i know how it feels to lie
all i want to do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i haven't got
sitting in an empty room
trying to forget the past
this was never meant to last
i wish it wasn't so
i know what it takes to move on
i know how it feels to lie
all i want to do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i haven't got
what was left when that fire was gone?
i thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
all caught up in the eye of the storm
and trying to figure out what it's like moving on
and i don't even know what kind of things i said
my mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
so, i'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
the hardest part of ending is starting again
all i want to do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i haven't got
this is not the end, this is not the beginning
just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
i'm holding on to what i haven't got
but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
though the words sound steady
something empty's within them
we say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
holding on to what i haven't got
'cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear
the cycle repeated
as explosions broke in the sky
all that i needed
was the one thing i couldn't find
and you were there at the turn
waiting to let me know
we're building it up to break it back down
we're building it up to burn it down
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
the colors conflicted
as the flames climbed into the clouds
i wanted to fix this
but couldn't stop from tearing it down
and you were there at the turn
caught in the burning glow
and i was there at the turn
waiting to let you know
we're building it up to break it back down
we're building it up to burn it down
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
you told me yes, you held me high
and i believed when you told that lie
i played soldier, you played king
and struck me down when i kissed that ring
you lost that right to hold that crown
i built you up but you let me down
so when you fall, i'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
and you were there, at the turn
waiting to let me know
we're building it up to break it back down
we're building it up to burn it down
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
when you fall, i'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
when you fall, i'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
we can't wait to burn it to the ground
i've got an aching head
echoes and buzzing noises
i know the words we said
but wish i could've turned our voices down
this is not black and white
only organized confusion
i'm just trying to get it right
and in spite of all i should've done
i was not mad at you
i was not trying to tear you down
the words that i could've used
i was too scared to say out loud
if i cannot break your fall
i'll pick you up right off the ground
if you felt invisible, i won't let you feel that now
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
you didn't get your way
and it's an empty feeling
you've got a lot to say
and you just want to know you're being heard
but this is not black and white
there are no clear solutions
i'm just trying to get it right
and in spite of all i should've done
i was not mad at you
i was not trying to tear you down
the words that i could've used
i was too scared to say out loud
if i cannot break your fall
i'll pick you up right off the ground
if you felt invisible, i won't let you feel that now
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
this is not black and white
there are no clear solutions
i'm just trying to get it right
and in spite of all i should've done
i was not mad at you
i was not trying to tear you down
the words that i could've used
i was too scared to say out loud
if i cannot break your fall
i'll pick you up right off the ground
if you felt invisible, i won't let you feel that now
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
invisible, invisible
yeah, yo
you were that foundation
never gonna be another one, no
i followed, so taken
so conditioned, i could never let go
then sorrow, then sickness
then the shock when you flip it on me
so hollow, so vicious
so afraid, i couldn't let myself see
that i could never be held
back or up, no, i hold myself
check the rep, yep, you know mine well
forget the rest, let them know my hell
there and back, yet my soul ain't sell
kept respect up, the best they fell
let the rest be the tale they tell
that i was there, saying
in these promises broken, deep below
each word gets lost in the echo
so, one last lie i can see through
this time, i finally let you go, go, go
test my will, test my heart
let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
y'all go hard, i go smart
how's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
i've seen that, frustration
been crossed and lost and told no
and i've come back, unshaken
let down and lived and let go
so, you can let it be known
i don't hold back, i hold my own
i can't be mapped, i can't be cloned
i can't c-flat, it ain't my tone
i can't fall back, i came too far
hold myself up and love my scars
let the bells ring wherever they are
'cause i was there, saying
in these promises broken, deep below
each word gets lost in the echo
so, one last lie i can see through
this time, i finally let you go!
no, you can tell 'em all now
i don't back up, i don't back down
i don't fold up and i don't bow
i don't roll over, don't know how
i don't care where the enemies are
can't be stopped, all i know, go hard
won't forget how i got this far
for every time, saying
in these promises broken deep below
each word gets lost in the echo
so, one last lie i can see through
this time, i finally let you go, go, go
go, go, go, go
i cannot take this anymore
saying everything i've said before
all these words they make no sense
i find bliss in ignorance
less i hear, the less you'll say
you'll find that out anyway
just like before
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
i'm about to break)
i find the answers aren't so clear
wish i could find a way to disappear
all these thoughts they make no sense
i find bliss in ignorance
nothing seems to go away
over and over again
just like before
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
i'm about to break)
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to)
break
shut up when i'm talking to you
shut up
shut up
shut up
shut up when i'm talking to you
shut up
shut up
shut up
shut up
i'm about to break
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
i'm about to break)
everything you say to me
(takes me one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to break)
i need a little room to breathe
('cause i'm one step closer to the edge
and i'm about to)
break
mama always told me don't you run
"don't you run with scissors, son
you're gonna hurt someone"
mama told me look before you leap
always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep
stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said
sharp edges have consequences, i
guess that i had to find out for myself
sharp edges have consequences, now
every scar is a story i can tell
should've played it safer from the start
loved you like a house of cards
let it fall apart
but all the things i couldn't understand
never could've planned
they made me who i am
put your nose in paperbacks
instead of smoking cigarettes
these are years you're never getting back
stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said
sharp edges have consequences, i
guess that i had to find out for myself
sharp edges have consequences, now
every scar is a story i can tell
we all fall down
we live somehow
we learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
we all fall down
we live somehow
we learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said
sharp edges have consequences, i
guess that i had to find out for myself
sharp edges have consequences, now
every scar is a story i can tell
we all fall down
we live somehow
we learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
we all fall down
we live somehow
we learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
watching the wings cut through the clouds
watching the raindrops blinking red and white
thinking of you back on the ground
there with a fire burning in your eyes
i only halfway apologized
and i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
sometimes things refuse
to go the way we planned
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there will be a day
that you will understand
you will understand
after a while you may forget
but just in case the memories cross your mind
you couldn't know this when i left
under the fire of your angry eyes
i never wanted to say goodbye
so i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
sometimes things refuse
to go the way we planned
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there will be a day
that you will understand
you will understand
yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up
tried to call home but nobody could wait up
switch your time zones can't pick the pace up
i just passed out by the time you wake up
best things come to those who wait
and it's bound to get rough on any road you take
but don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake
i can't wait to come back when i'm going away
so i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there are things we have to do that we can't stand
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there will be a day that you will understand
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there are things we have to do that we can't stand
(things we have to do that we can't stand)
oh i'll be sorry for now
that i couldn't be around
there will be a day that you will understand
you will understand
you will understand
you will understand
i watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
shining with the light from the sun
the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
the moon's gonna owe it one
it makes me think of how you act to me
you do favors and then rapidly
just turn around and start asking me
about things that you want back from me
i'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place, to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
i want to be in another place
i hate when you say you don't understand
(you'll see it's not meant to be)
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
a place for my head
(maybe someday i'll be just like you and)
step on people like you do and
run away the people i thought i knew
i remember back then who you were
you used to be calm, used to be strong
used to be generous but you should've known
that you'd wear out your welcome
and now you see how quiet it is, all alone
i'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
i'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
i want to be in another place
i hate when you say you don't understand
(you'll see it's not meant to be)
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
a place for my head
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
you try to take the best of me, go away
i want to be in another place
i hate when you say you don't understand
(you'll see it's not meant to be)
i want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
a place for my head
stay away
i am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
i'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
sick of you acting like i owe you this
find another place to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest
stay away from me
i close both locks below the window
i close both blinds and turn away
sometimes solutions aren't so simple
sometimes goodbye's the only way
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
in cards and flowers on your window
your friends all plead for you to stay
sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
sometimes goodbye's the only way
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
i remembered black skies
the lightning all around me
i remembered each flash
as time began to blur
like a startling sign
that fate had finally found me
and your voice was all i heard
that i get what i deserve
so give me reason
to prove me wrong
to wash this memory clean
let the floods cross
the distance in your eyes
give me reason
to fill this hole
connect this space between
let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
across this new divide
there was nothing in sight
but memories left abandoned
there was nowhere to hide
the ashes fell like snow
and the ground caved in
between where we were standing
and your voice was all i heard
that i get what i deserve
so give me reason
to prove me wrong
to wash this memory clean
let the floods cross
the distance in your eyes
across this new divide
in every loss in every lie
in every truth that you deny
and each regret and each goodbye
was a mistake too great to hide
and your voice was all i heard
that i get what i deserve
so give me reason
to prove me wrong
to wash this memory clean
let the floods cross
the distance in your eyes
give me reason
to fill this hole
connect this space between
let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
across this new divide
across this new divide
across this new divide
weep not for roads untraveled
weep not for paths left lone
'cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
it's the worst kind of pain i've known
give up your heart, left broken
and let that mistake pass on
'cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
and in time, you'll be glad it's gone
whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
weep not for roads untraveled
weep not for sights unseen
may your love never end, and if you need a friend
there's a seat here alongside me
whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
used to get high with the dead end kids
abandoned houses where the shadows lived
i never been higher than i was that night
i woke up driving my car
i couldn't see then what i see right now
the road dissolving like an empty vow
couldn't remember where i'd been that night
i knew i took it too far
all you said to do was slow down
i remember, now i remember
all you said to do was slow down
but i was already gone
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
i know what i want, but it feels like i'm paralyzed
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right (halfway right)
told me "kid, you're going way too fast
you burn too bright, you know you'll never last"
it was bullshit then, i guess it makes sense now
i woke up driving my car
said i'd lose you if i lost control
i just laughed because what do they know?
here i am, standing all alone
because i took it too far
all you said to do was slow down
i remember, now i remember
all you said to do was slow down
but i was already gone
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
i know what i want, but it feels like i'm paralyzed
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right , halfway right
na na na na na na na na
nana nana, na nana nana
na na na na na na na na
but i was already gone
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
na na na na na na na na
nana nana, na nana nana
na na na na na na na na
but i was already gone
i scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
i don't lose, i don't win, if i'm wrong, then i'm halfway right
when you were standing in the wake of devastation
when you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
and with the cataclysm raining down
insides crying, "save me now"
you were there, impossibly alone
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure's all you've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go, let it go
and in a burst of light that blinded every angel
as if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
you felt the gravity of tempered grace
falling into empty space
no one there to catch you in their arms
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go, let it go
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure's all you've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go
let it go
let it go
let it go
let it go
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure's all you've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go, let it go
forfeit the game before somebody else
takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
cover up your face, you can't run the race
the pace is too fast, you just won't last
you love the way i look at you
while taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
you take away if i give in
my life, my pride is broken
you like to think you're never wrong
you live what you've learned
you have to act like you're someone
you live what you've learned
you want someone to hurt like you
you live what you've learned
you want to share what you have been through
you live what you've learned
you love the things i say i do
the way i hurt myself again, just to get back at you
you take away, when i give in
my life, my pride is broken
you like to think you're never wrong
you live what you've learned
you have to act like you're someone

god bless us everyone
we're a broken people living under loaded gun
and it can't be outfought

and when i close my eyes tonight
to symphonies of blinding light!
god bless us everyone
we're a broken people living under loaded gun
oh, like memories in cold decay
transmissions echoing away
far from the world of you and i
where oceans bleed into the sky!
god save us everyone
will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
for the sins of our hand
the sins of our tongue
the sins of our father
the sins of our young? no!
god save us everyone
will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?

turn my mic up louder, i got to say something
lightweights step it aside when we come in
feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping
people on the street, they panic and start running
words on loose leaf sheet complete coming
i jump in my mind and summon the rhyme i'm dumping
healing the blind, i promise to let the sun in
sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming
jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
fuck that, i wanna see some fists pumping
risk something, take back what's yours
say something that you know they might attack you for
'cause i'm sick of being treated like i have before
like it's stupid standing for what i'm standing for
like this war's really just a different brand of war
like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
like they understand you in the back of the jet
when you can't put gas in your tank
and these fuckers are laughing their way to the bank
cashing the check
asking you to have compassion and have some respect
for a leader so nervous in an obvious way
stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
and the rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
in the living room laughing like, "what did he say?"
amen, amen
amen, amen
amen
in my living room watching but i am not laughing
'cause when it gets tense, i know what might happen
the world is cold, the bold men take action
have to react or get blown into fractions
ten years old, it's something to see
another kid my age drugged under a jeep
taken and bound and found later under a tree
i wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
do you see the soldiers that are out, today?
they brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
it's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
but a bomb blew the mosque up, yesterday
there's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
inside your market, your shops, your clothes
my dad, he's got a lot of fear, i know
but enough pride inside not to let that show
my brother had a book he would hold with pride
a little red cover with a broken spine on the back
he hand-wrote a quote, inside
"when the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"
meanwhile, the leader just talks away
stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
the rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
both scared and angry, like "what did he say?"
amen, amen
amen, amen
amen
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
with hands held high into a sky so blue
as the ocean opens up to swallow you
waking in sweat again
another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
stuck in my head again
feels like i'll never leave this place, there's no escape
i'm my own worst enemy...
i've given up, i'm sick of feeling
is there nothing you can say?
take this all away, i'm suffocating
tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
i don't know what to take
thought i was focused but i'm scared, i'm not prepared
i hyperventilate
looking for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares
i'm my own worst enemy
i've given up, i'm sick of feeling
is there nothing you can say?
take this all away, i'm suffocating
tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
god!
put me out of my misery!
put me out of my misery!
put me out of my
put me out of my fucking misery!
i've given up, i'm sick of feeling
is there nothing you can say?
take this all away, i'm suffocating
tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
i don't know who to trust, no surprise
everyone feels so far away from me
heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
trying not to break, but i'm so tired of this deceit
every time i try to make myself get back up on my feet
all i ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
and how trying to put my trust in you
just takes so much out of me
(i) take everything from the inside
and throw it all away
'cause i swear, for the last time
i won't trust myself with you
tension is building inside, steadily
everyone feels so far away from me
heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me
trying not to break, but i'm so tired of this deceit
every time i try to make myself get back up on my feet
all i ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
and how trying to put my trust in you
just takes so much out of me
(i) take everything from the inside
and throw it all away
'cause i swear, for the last time
i won't trust myself with you
i won't waste myself on you
you
you
waste myself on you
you
you
i'll take everything from the inside
and throw it all away
'cause i swear, for the last time
i won't trust myself with you
everything from the inside
and just throw it all away
'cause i swear, for the last time
i won't trust myself with you
you
you
when i pretend everything is what i want it to be
i look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
when i pretend, i can forget about the criminal i am
stealing second after second, just 'cause i know i can
but, i can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
i'm just (trying to bend the truth)
i can't pretend i'm who you want me to be
so i'm (lying my way from)
you (no, no turning back, now)
i wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(no, no turning back, now)
let me take back my life
i’d rather be all alone (no turning back, now)
anywhere on my own, 'cause i can see
(no, no turning back, now)
the very worst part of you is me
i remember what they taught to me
remember condescending talk of who i ought to be
remember listening to all of that and this, again
so, i pretended up a person who was fitting in
and now, you think this person really is me
and i'm (trying to bend the truth)
but the more i push, the more i'm pulling away
'cause i'm (lying my way from)
you (no, no turning back, now)
i wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(no, no turning back, now)
let me take back my life
i’d rather be all alone (no turning back, now)
anywhere on my own, 'cause i can see
(no, no turning back, now)
the very worst part of you
the very worst part of you is me
this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said
would have you running from me, like this
this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said
would have you running from me, like this
(this) this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said
would have you running from me, like this
(this) this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said
would have you running from me, like this
you (no turning back, now)
i wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(no, no turning back, now)
let me take back my life
i’d rather be all alone (no turning back, now)
anywhere on my own, 'cause i can see
(no, no turning back, now)
the very worst part of you
the very worst part of you is me
there's an emptiness tonight
a hole that wasn't there before
and i keep reaching for the light
but i can't find it anymore
there's an emptiness tonight
a heavy hand that pulls me down
they say it's gonna be alright
but can't begin to tell me how
and i ask myself out loud...
"have i been lost all along?
was there something i could say, or something i should not have done?
was i lost all along?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?"
is there sunshine where you are?
the way there was when you were here
'cause i'm just sitting in the dark
in disbelief that this is real
in disbelief that this is real
have i been lost all along?
was there something i could say or something i should not have done?
was i lost all along?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?
and i ask myself out loud...
"have i been lost all along?
was there something i could say or something i should not have done?
was i lost all along?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?
was i looking for an answer when there never really was one?"
tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say
and suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'cause i don't have a reason and you don't have the time
but we both keep on waiting for something we won't find
the light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
with shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
we said it was forever, but then it slipped away
standing at the end of the final masquerade
the final masquerade
all i ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
all you ever wanted, the truth i couldn't speak
'cause i can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime
but we both keep on waiting, for what we left behind
the light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
with shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
we said it was forever, but then it slipped away
standing at the end of the final masquerade
the final masquerade
the final masquerade
standing at the end of the final masquerade
the light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
with shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
we said it was forever, but then it slipped away
standing at the end of the final masquerade
standing at the end of the final masquerade
standing at the end of the final masquerade
the final masquerade
when you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world
your instincts telling you to run
listen to your heart, those angel voices
they'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
it keeps us kind
when you've suffered enough and your spirit is breaking
you're growing desperate from the fight
remember you're loved and you always will be
this melody will bring you right back home
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
i woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
and put my cold feet on the floor
forgot all about yesterday
remembering i'm pretending to be where i'm not anymore
a little taste of hypocrisy
and i'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
and though you're so close to me
you're still so distant and i can't bring you back
it's true, the way i feel
was promised by your face
the sound of your voice
painted on my memories
even if you're not with me
i'm with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
i hit you and you hit me back
we fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
fine line between this and that
when things go wrong, i pretend the past isn't real
now i'm trapped in this memory
and i'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
so even though you're close to me
you're still so distant and i can't bring you back
it's true the way i feel
was promised by your face
the sound of your voice
painted on my memories
even if you're not with me
i'm with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
no, no matter how far we've come
i can't wait to see tomorrow
no matter how far we've come
i, i can't wait to see tomorrow
with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
with you
you, now i see, keeping everything inside
with you
you, now i see, even when i close my eyes
it's easier to run
replacing this pain with something numb
it's so much easier to go
than face all this pain here all alone
something has been taken
from deep inside of me
a secret i've kept locked away
no one can ever see
wounds so deep, they never show
they never go away
like moving pictures in my head
for years and years they've played
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
if i could take all the shame to the grave, i would
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
i would take all my shame to the grave
it's easier to run
replacing this pain with something numb
it's so much easier to go
than face all this pain here all alone
sometimes, i remember
the darkness of my past
bringing back these memories
i wish i didn't have
sometimes, i think of letting go
and never looking back
and never moving forward, so
there'd never be a past
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
if i could take all the shame to the grave, i would
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
i would take all my shame to the grave
just washing it aside
all of the helplessness inside
pretending i don't feel misplaced
is so much simpler than change
it's easier to run
replacing this pain with something numb
it's so much easier to go
than face all this pain here all alone
it's easier to run
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made
it's easier to go
if i could change, i would, take back the pain, i would
retrace every wrong move that i made, i would
if i could stand up and take the blame, i would
i would take all my shame to the grave
what do i do to ignore them behind me?
do i follow my instincts blindly?
do i hide my pride from these bad dreams
and give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
do i sit here and try to stand it?
or do i try to catch them red-handed?
do i trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
or do i trust nobody and live in loneliness?
because i can't hold on when i'm stretched so thin
i make the right moves, but i'm lost within
i put on my daily façade, but then
i just end up getting hurt again
by myself (myself) i ask why
(but in my mind, i find) i can't rely on myself
(myself) i ask why
(but in my mind, i find) i can't rely on myself
i can't hold on (to what i want when i'm stretched so thin)
it's all too much to take in
i can't hold on (to anything, watching everything spin)
with thoughts of failure sinking in
if i turn my back, i'm defenseless
and to go blindly seems senseless
if i hide my pride and let it all go on
then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
if i let them go, i'll be outdone
but if i try to catch them, i'll be outrun
if i'm killed by the questions like a cancer
then i'll be buried in the silence of the answer
by myself (myself) i ask why
(but in my mind, i find) i can't rely on myself
(myself) i ask why
(but in my mind, i find) i can't rely on myself
i can't hold on (to what i want when i'm stretched so thin)
it's all too much to take in
i can't hold on (to anything, watching everything spin)
with thoughts of failure sinking in
how do you think i've lost so much?
i'm so afraid that i'm out of touch
how do you expect i will know what to do
when all i know is what you tell me to?
don't you (know)
i can't tell you how to make it (go)
no matter what i do, how hard i (try)
i can't seem to convince myself (why)
i'm stuck on the outside
don't you (know)
i can't tell you how to make it (go)
no matter what i do, how hard i (try)
i can't seem to convince myself (why)
i'm stuck on the outside
i can't hold on (to what i want when i'm stretched so thin)
it's all too much to take in
i can't hold on (to anything, watching everything spin)
with thoughts of failure sinking in
i can't hold on (to what i want when i'm stretched so thin)
it's all too much to take in
i can't hold on (to anything, watching everything spin)
with thoughts of failure sinking
nothing ever stops all these thoughts
and the pain attached to them
sometimes i wonder why this is happening
it's like nothing i could do will distract me when
i think of how i shot myself in the back again
'cause from the infinite words, i could say
i put all the pain you gave to me on display
but didn't realize, instead of setting it free
i took what i hated and made it a part of me
it never goes away
it never goes away
and now, you've become a part of me
(you'll always be right here)
you've become a part of me
(you'll always be my fear)
i can't separate
(myself from what i've done)
giving up a part of me
i've let myself become you
hearing your name, the memories come back again
i remember when it started happening
i'd see you in every thought i had, and then
the thoughts slowly found words attached to them
and i knew as they escaped away
i was committing myself to them, and everyday
i regret saying those things, 'cause now
i see that i took what i hated and made it a part of me
it never goes away
it never goes away
and now, you've become a part of me
(you'll always be right here)
you've become a part of me
(you'll always be my fear)
i can't separate
(myself from what i've done)
giving up a part of me
i've let myself become you
never goes away, never goes away
it never goes away, it never goes away
(get away from me)
gimme my space back, you gotta just (go)
everything comes down to memories of (you)
i've kept it in, but now i'm letting you (know)
i've let you go, so get away from me
gimme my space back, you gotta just (go)
everything comes down to memories of (you)
i've kept it in, but now i'm letting you (know)
i've let you go!
and now, you've become a part of me
(you'll always be right here)
you've become a part of me
(you'll always be my fear)
i can't separate
(myself from what i've done)
giving up a part of me
i've let myself become you
i've let myself become you
i've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
giving up a part of me
i've let myself become you
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
there's a place so dark, you can't see the end
skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
the rain then sends dripping acidic questions
forcefully, the power of suggestion
then with the eyes shut, looking through the rust and rot
and dust, a small spot of light floods the floor
and pours over the rusted world of pretend
and the eyes ease open and it's dark again
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
in the memory, you'll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up
moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
pollution manifested in perpetual sound
the wheels go round and the sunset creeps
behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
a little piece of paper with a picture drawn
floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
and the memory now is like the picture was then
when the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
from the top to the bottom (bottom to top, i stop)
at the core, i've forgotten (in the middle of my thoughts)
taken far from my safety (the picture's there)
the memory won't escape me (but why should i care?)
in the memory, you'll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
i'm telling you that i see it right through you
in the memory, you'll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up
in the memory, you will find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up
come, come, come
come, coming at you...
come, coming at you...
come, coming at you...
yo...
peep the style and the kids checking for it
the number one question is: how could you ignore it?
we drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
with raps that got you backing this up like "rewind that"
we're just rolling with the rhythm
rise from the ashes of stylistic division
with these non-stop lyrics of life living
not to be forgotten, but still unforgiven
but in the meantime, there are those who wanna talk this and that
so i suppose that it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
and get dirty with the people spreading the dirt
it goes:
try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
i got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
and everything left's a waste of time
i hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more
i'm riding on the back of this pressure
guessing that it's better i can't keep myself together
because all of this stress gave me something to write on
the pain gave me something i could set my sights on
you never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
the uphill struggle over years, the fear
and trash-talking and the people it was to
and the people that started it, just like you
try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
i got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
nothing to gain, everything to fear
heart full of pain, head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
nothing to gain, everything to fear
heart full of pain
try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
(told you everything loud and clear) but nobody's listening
i got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
nobody's listening
handful of anger held in my chest
nobody's listening
uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
nobody's listening
nothing to gain, everything to fear
nobody's listening
come, come, come, come, coming at you...
come, coming, come, come, coming at you...
come, coming, come, come, coming at...
come, come, come, come
coming at you from every side
i've lied to you
the same way that i always do
this is the last smile
that i'll fake for the sake of being with you
everything falls apart, even the people
who never frown eventually break down
the sacrifice of hiding in a lie
everything has to end, you'll soon find
we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
the sacrifice is never knowing
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
i've tried, like you
to do everything you wanted to
this is the last time
i'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
everything falls apart, even the people
who never frown eventually break down
the sacrifice of hiding in a lie
everything has to end, you'll soon find
we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
the sacrifice is never knowing
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
we're all out of time
this is how we find how it all unwinds
the sacrifice of hiding in a lie
we're all out of time
this is how we find how it all unwinds
the sacrifice is never knowing
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
why i never walked away, why i played myself this way
now i see your testing me pushes me away
graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
a constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
the lessons that you taught me, i learned were never true
now i find myself in question
they point the finger at me again
guilty by association
you point the finger at me again
i wanna run away, never say goodbye
i wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
i wanna know the answers, no more lies
i wanna shut the door and open up my mind
paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
another wave of tension has more than filled me up
all my talk of taking action, these words were never true
now i find myself in question
they point the finger at me again
guilty by association
you point the finger at me again
i wanna run away, never say goodbye
i wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
i wanna know the answers, no more lies
i wanna shut the door and open up my mind
i'm gonna run away and never say goodbye
gonna run away, gonna run away
gonna run away, gonna run away
i'm gonna run away and never wonder why
gonna run away, gonna run away
gonna run away, gonna run away
i'm gonna run away and open up my mind
gonna run away, gonna run away
mind (gonna run away, gonna run away)
mind (gonna run away, gonna run away)
mind (gonna run away, gonna run away)
i wanna run away, never say goodbye
i wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
i wanna know the answers, no more lies
i wanna shut the door and open up my mind
i wanna run away and open up my mind
i wanna run away and open up my mind
i wanna run away and open up my mind
i wanna run away and open up my mind
sometimes i need to remember just to breathe
sometimes i need you to stay away from me
sometimes i'm in disbelief i didn't know
somehow, i need you to go
don't stay (forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
what you were changing me into (just give me myself back and) don't stay
(forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
take all your faithlessness with you (just give me myself back and) don't stay
sometimes i feel like i trusted you too well
sometimes i just feel like screaming at myself
sometimes i'm in disbelief i didn't know
somehow, i need to be alone
don't stay (forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
what you were changing me into (just give me myself back and) don't stay
(forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
take all your faithlessness with you (just give me myself back and) don't stay
i don't need you anymore
i don't want to be ignored
i don't need one more day of you wasting me away
i don't need you anymore
i don't want to be ignored
i don't need one more day of you wasting me away
with no apologies
don't stay (forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
what you were changing me into (just give me myself back and) don't stay
(forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
take all your faithlessness with you (just give me myself back and) don't stay
don't stay
don't stay
yeah
i am not a pattern to be followed
the pill that i'm on is a tough one to swallow
i'm not a criminal, not a role model
not a born leader, i'm a tough act to follow
i am not the fortune and the fame
nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game
i came in the ring like a dog on a chain
and i found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
and it seems ugly, but it can get worse
'cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
and i'm not a robot, i'm not a monkey
i will not dance, even if the beat's funky
opposite of lazy far from a punk
you all ought to stop talking
start trying to catch up, motherfucker!
and all the people say
try to catch up motherfucker!
lauryn said money change a situation
big said it increase the complication
kane said "don't step. i ain't the one."
chuck said that uzi weigh a motherfucking ton
and i'm just a student of the game that they taught me
rocking every stage in every place that it brought me
i'm awfully underrated
but came here to correct it
and so it ain't mistaken, i'ma state it for the record
i am
the opposite of wack
opposite of weak
opposite of slack
synonym of heat
synonym of crack
closest to a peak
far from a punk
you all ought to stop talking
start trying to catch up, motherfucker!
and all the people say
try to catch up motherfucker!
oh, when they come for me
come for me, i'll be gone
oh, when they come for me
come for me, i'll be gone
oh, when they come for me
come for me, i'll be gone
and all the people say
try to catch up motherfucker!
and all the people say
try to catch up motherfucker!

this is my december
this is my time of the year
this is my december
this is all so clear
this is my december
this is my snow-covered home
this is my december
this is me, alone
(and i) just wish that i didn't feel
like there was something i missed
(and i) take back all the things i said
to make you feel like that
(and i) just wish that i didn't feel
like there was something i missed
(and i) take back all the things
that i said to you
and i'd give it all away
just to have somewhere to go to
give it all away
to have someone to come home to
this is my december
these are my snow-covered dreams
this is me pretending
this is all i need

give it all away
to have someone to come home to
i used the deadwood to make the fire rise
the blood of innocence burning in the skies
i filled my cup with the rising of the sea
and poured it out in an ocean of debris
i'm swimming in the smoke
of bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve
we held our breath when the clouds began to form
but you were lost in the beating of the storm
and in the end, we were made to be apart
like separate chambers of the human heart
i'm swimming in the smoke
of bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
it's in the blackened bones
of bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve
i'm swimming in the smoke
of bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
the blame is mine, alone
for bridges i have burned
so don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve, oh
what i don't deserve
i use the deadwood to make the fire rise
the blood of innocence burning in the skies
water grey
through the windows, up the stairs
chilling rain
like an ocean, everywhere
don't want to reach for me, do you?
i mean nothing to you
the little things give you away
and now there will be no mistaking
the levees are breaking
all you've ever wanted
was someone to truly look up to you
and six feet underwater, i do
hope decays
generations disappear
washed away
as a nation simply stares
don't want to reach for me, do you?
i mean nothing to you
the little things give you away
and now there will be no mistaking
the levees are breaking
all you've ever wanted
was someone to truly look up to you
and six feet underwater, i do
all you've ever wanted
was someone to truly look up to you
and six feet underground
now i, now i do
the little things give you away
the little things give you away
the little things give you away
the little things give you away
all you've ever wanted
the little things give you away
was someone to truly look up to you
the little things give you away
all you've ever wanted
the little things give you away
was someone to truly look up to you
the little things give you away
all you've ever wanted
the little things give you away
was someone to truly look up to you
the little things give you away
all you've ever wanted
the little things give you away
was someone to truly look up to you
the little things give you away
all you've ever wanted
the little things give you away
was someone to truly look up to you
the little things give you away
all you've ever wanted
the little things give you away
was someone to truly look up to you
the little things give you away
tell us all again what you think we should be
what the answers are, what it is we can't see
tell us all again how to do what you say
how to fall in line, how there's no other way
but oh, we all know
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
you're guilty all the same
show us all again, that our hands are unclean
that we're unprepared, that you have what we need
show us all again 'cause we cannot be saved
'cause the end is near, now there's no other way
and oh, you will know
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
there's no one else to blame
guilty all the same
guilty all the same
you're guilty all the same
yeah, you already know what it is
can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
when a man has plans of being rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
it's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
they talk team and take the paper route
all they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
at anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
no regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
the smoke screen before the flame
knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
they say it's time for things to change
rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
it's real deep until no more remains, but i'm still me
like authentic hip-hop and rock
till pop and radio and record companies killed me
try to force me to stray and obey
and got the gall to say how real can real be?
you feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
tv or a name, the media, the game, to me you're all the same
you're guilty
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
you're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
you want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
there's no one else to blame
guilty all the same
guilty all the same
guilty all the same
there's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
you can't even passively take part
and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
and you've got to make it stop
to save face, how low can you go
talk a lot of game but yet you don't know
static on the way, make us all say whoa
the people up top push the people down low
get down
and obey every word
steady getting mine if you haven't yet heard
wanna take what i got, don't be absurd
don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
if you haven't heard yet then i'm letting you know
there ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
and no one make a move unless my people say so
got everything outta control
now everybody go
steel unload, final blow
we the animals, take control
hear us now, clear and true
wretches and kings we come for you
so keep pace, how slow can you go
talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know
fire on the way, make you all say whoa
the people up top and the people down low
get down
and i'm running it like that
the front of the attack is exactly where i'm at
somewhere in-between, the kick and the hi-hat
the pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
so get with the combat, i'm letting 'em know
there ain't shit you can say to make me back down no
so push the button let the whole thing blow
spinning everything outta control
now everybody go
steel unload, final blow
we the animals, take control
hear us now, clear and true
wretches and kings we come for you
steel unload, fire blow
filthy animals, beat them low
skin and bone, black and blue
no more this sun shall beat onto you
from the front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put 'em up real high
when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
you can't even passively take part
and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
and you've got to make it stop
and you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it
that unless you're free
the machine will be prevented from working at all
there are just too many
times that people
have tried to look inside of me
wondering what i think of you
and i protect you out of courtesy
too many times that i’ve
held on when i needed to push away
afraid to say what was on my mind
afraid to say what i need to say
too many things that you’ve said about me when i’m not around
you think having the upper hand
means you gotta keep puttin' me down
but i’ve had too many stand-offs with you
it’s about as much as i can stand
so i'm waiting until the upper hand is mine
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
watch it drop)
making your heart stop
(just before you hit the floor)
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
missed your shot)
making your heart stop
(you think you won)
and then it's all gone
so many people like me
put so much trust in all your lies
so concerned with what you think
to just say what we feel inside
so many people like me
walk on eggshells all day long
all i know is that all i want
is to feel like i’m not stepped on
there are so many things you say
that make me feel you crossed the line
what goes up will surely fall
and i’m counting down the time
'cause i’ve had so many stand-offs with you
it’s about as much as i can stand
so i’m waiting until the upper hand is mine
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
watch it drop)
making your heart stop
(just before you hit the floor)
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
missed your shot)
making your heart stop
(you think you won)
and then it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
now it's all gone
i know i’ll never trust a single thing you say
you knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
and all the lies have got you floating up above us all
but what goes up has got to fall
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
watch it drop)
making your heart stop
(just before you hit the floor)
one minute, you’re on top
(the next you’re not
missed your shot)
making your heart stop
(you think you won)
and then it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
and then, it's all gone
now it's all gone
i'm stuck in this bed you made
alone with a sinking feeling
i saw through the words you said
to the secrets you've been keeping
it's written upon your face
all the lies, how they cut so deeply
you can't get enough, you take
and take and take and never say
no! you've gotta get it inside!
you push it back down! you push it back down!
no! you'll never get it inside!
push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!
you say that it's not your fault
and swear that i am mistaken
you said it's not what it seems
no remorse for the trust you're breaking
you run but then back, you fall
suffocate in the mess you're making
you can't get enough you take
and take and take and take and take
fuck it, are you listening?
no! you've gotta get it inside!
you push it back down! you push it back down!
no! you'll never get it inside!
push it back down! you push it back down!
no! you've gotta get it inside!
you push it back down! you push it back down!
no! you'll never get it inside!
push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
you push it back down! push it back down!
you push it back down, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
blackout, blood in your eye!
floating down, as colors fill the light
we look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
and floating up, you pass us in the night
a future gazing out, a past to overwrite
so, come down, far below
we've been waiting to collect the things you know
come down, far below
we've been waiting to collect what you've let go
come down, oh
come down, oh
come down, oh
come down, oh
come down, oh
my insides all turned to ash, so slow
and blew away as i collapsed, so cold
a black wind took them away from sight
and held the darkness over day, that night
and the clouds above move closer
looking so dissatisfied
but the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
i used to be my own protection, but not now
'cause my path has lost direction, somehow
a black wind took you away from sight
and held the darkness over day, that night
and the clouds above move closer
looking so dissatisfied
and the ground below grew colder
as they put you down inside
but the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
so now, you're gone and i was wrong
i never knew what it was like to be alone
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
(i used to be my own protection, but not now)
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
('cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
(i used to be my own protection, but not now)
on a valentine's day, on a valentine's day
('cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
separate
sifting through the wreckage, i can't concentrate
searching for a message in that fear and pain
broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive
now, in my remains
are promises that never came
set this silence free
to wash away the worst of me
come apart
falling in the cracks of every broken heart
digging through the wreckage of your disregard
sinking down and waiting for the chance to feel alive
now, in my remains
are promises that never came
set this silence free
to wash away the worst of me
like an army falling one by one by one
like an army falling one by one by one
like an army falling one by one by one
like an army falling one by one by one
now, in my remains (one by one, one by one)
are promises that never came (one by one by one)
set this silence free (one by one, one by one)
to wash away the worst of me (one by one by one)
like an army falling (one by one, one by one)
one by one by one (one by one by one)
like an army falling (one by one, one by one)
one by one by one
you hid your skeletons when i had shown you mine
you woke the devil that i thought you'd left behind
i saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose
and you held it all
but you were careless to let it fall
you held it all
and i was by your side, powerless
i watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
i'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend
you'll never know what i became because of you
ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose
and you held it all
but you were careless to let it fall
you held it all
and i was by your side, powerless
 (x2)
oh, oh-oh
oh
oh, oh-oh
oh
and you held it all
but you were careless to let it fall
you held it all
and i was by your side, powerless
powerless, powerless
a fire needs a space to burn
a breath to build a glow
i've heard it said a thousand times
but now i know
that you don't know what you've got
oh, you don't know what you've got
no, you don't know what you've got
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
i thought i kept you safe and sound
i thought i made you strong
but something made me realize
that i was wrong
'cause finding what you've got sometimes
means finding it alone
and i can finally see your light
when i let go
'cause you don't know what you've got
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
until it's gone
'cause you don't know what you've got
oh, you don't know what you've got
no, you don't know what you've got
it's your battle to be fought
no, you don't know what you've got
till it's gone
till it's gone
till it's gone
.
yeah
uh
so what'cha waiting for, anticipating more
while you debate what it could take to instigate a war?
yeah, i been hated more than time i wasn't hated for
there's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before
but you could never see it, your battle's not mine
wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time
while you're waiting for a purpose, i already got mine
while you tell me step to it like "one, two, three, four"
and if i do what you demand
(you say!) you'll let me understand
(you say!) you're gonna hold me to your word
and if i sell myself away
(you say!) i'll have no debt to pay
(you say!) i'm gonna get what i deserve
your word, obeyed
my debt, repaid
our trust, betrayed
all for nothing! all for nothing!
kick back, there's no other way to say it
so let me break this fucker down for you, i really don't know you
you talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia
you're joking, i don't have a half a sucker bone to throw you
i'm disgusted
wonder what could've made you tuck your tail below you
and no, i'm not your soldier, i'm not taking any orders
i'm a five-star general infantry controller
need a lesson? let me show you
have you checking your composure
while i make you step to it like "one, two, three, four"?
and if i do what you demand
(you say!) you'll let me understand
(you say!) you're gonna hold me to your word
and if i sell myself away
(you say!) i'll have no debt to pay
(you say!) i'm gonna get what i deserve
and if i do what you demand
you'll let me understand
your word, obeyed
my debt, repaid
our trust, betrayed
all for nothing! all for nothing!
all for nothing! all for nothing!
 “we're (going?) too far”
 “i don't think we're too far”
 “we are”
 “there's a difference. put the heavy shit there”
 “the heavy shit right here?”
are you lost in your lies?
do you tell yourself i don't realize
your crusade's a disguise
replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives
i'm aware of what you've done
no, no more sorrow
i've paid for your mistakes
your time is borrowed
your time has come to be replaced
i see pain, i see need
i see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
i had hope, i believed
but i'm beginning to think that i've been deceived
you will pay for what you've done
no, no more sorrow
i've paid for your mistakes
your time is borrowed
your time has come to be replaced
thieves and hypocrites
thieves and hypocrites
thieves and hypocrites
no, no more sorrow
i've paid for your mistakes
your time is borrowed
your time has come to be replaced
no, no more sorrow
i've paid for your mistakes
your time is borrowed
your time has come to be replaced
your time has come to be replaced
your time has come to be erased
telling me to go
but hands beg me to stay
your lips say that you love
your eyes say that you hate
there's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
what you build, you lay to waste
there's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
all i've got's what you didn't take
so i, i won't be the one
be the one to leave this in pieces
and you, you will be alone
alone with all your secrets and regrets
don't lie
you promise me the sky
then toss me like a stone
you wrap me in your arms
then chill me to the bone
there's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
all i've got's what you didn't take
so i, i won't be the one
be the one to leave this in pieces
and you, you will be alone
alone with all your secrets and regrets
don't lie
so i, i won't be the one
be the one to leave this in pieces
and you, you will be alone
alone with all your secrets and regrets
don't lie
no control, no surprise
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
i'm my own casualty
i fuck up everything i see, fighting in futility
we start the final war, tell me what's worth fighting for
when we know there's nothing more
we take the hand or fist just to sell ourselves for this
the path we least resist
no control, no surprise
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
i'm my own casualty
i fuck up everything i see, fighting in futility
i give you what you came for, this is not the same though
got a different method, but i still can bring the pain, so
y'all all get that same flow, i got that insane flow
high as y'all can get, you're never really in my range though
yes, i'm half anglo, half-fried panko
all prime-time rhymer, let the bass bang low
all you fucking lames go aiming at my name, know
careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
no control, no surprise
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
i'm my own casualty
i fuck up everything i see, fighting in futility
no control, no surprise
tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
i'm my own casualty
i'm my own casualty
"i'm not allowed to say certain things! ahh!"
try and do... try and do the other thing, real quick
it goes a one, two, three
i was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
i don't need to sweat it when a competition come
original style like an 808 drum
so i don't run the track, no, i make the track run
my mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
i put 'em both together, now tell me what i got
it's a pretty smart weapon, i can shoot it, i can drop it
but learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it
like that
it ain't over 'cause the
shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
and anything you do they wanna get a little bite
it really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'cause once they get their teeth in, nothing really fights
and as for me, i do it like i got nothing to lose
and you can run your mouth like you can try to fill my shoes
but steady little soldier, i ain't standing next to you
i'd be laying on the ground before you're even in my view
like that
give me the strength of the rising sun
give me the truth of the words unsung
and when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
"bring me to kingdom come"
it's something for your people on the block
to black out and rock to
give me what you need like poppa, who shot you?
"separate the weak from the obsolete"
you're meek, i creep hard on impostors
and switch styles on a dime, quick-witted
y'all quit tripping, i don't have time for your crying
i grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup?
bang, bang, little monkey man playing with the big guns
only get you slain, i ain't playing, i'm just saying
you ain't got a sliver of a chance
i get iller, i deliver while you quiver in your pants
so shake, shake down, money, here's the breakdown
you can play the bank, i'mma play the bank takedown
and no mistakes now, i'm coming to get you
i'm just a banksy, you're a brainwash
get the picture?
it's like that
we swim against the rising waves
and crash against the shore
the body bends until it breaks
the early morning sings no more
so rest your head, it's time to sleep
and dream of what's in store
the body bends until it breaks
and sings again no more
'cause time has torn the flesh away
the early morning sings no more
today, we stood on the wall
we laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
we laughed at it all
and when they, they told us to go
we paid them no mind like every other time
but little did we know
today, i looked for a sign
with flames in my hands
a line in the sand between yours and mine
and it came like fire from below
your greed led the call, my flag had to fall
but little did you know
another day, your truth will come
you're gonna pay for what you've
pay for what you've done
you'll get what's yours and face your crime
you'll tell them, "give me back what's mine"
"give me back what's mine!"
i'd never been a coward, i'd never seen blood
you'd sold me an ocean, and i was lost in the flood
we were counting on a leader, we were driven by need
but couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed
you were steady as a sniper, we were waiting on a wire
so we never saw it coming when you ran from the fire
you can try intimidation and you can try to ignore
but when the time comes calling, yeah, you are gonna get yours
another day, your truth will come
you're gonna pay for what you've
pay for what you've done
you'll get what's yours and face your crime
you'll tell them "give me back what's mine"
"give me back what's mine!"
and so today, your truth has come
you're gonna pay for what you've
pay for what you've done
you'll get what's yours, you're out of time
and you will give me back what's mine
give me back what's mine!
give me, give me back what's mine!
give me, give me back what's mine!
what's mine!
give me, give me back what's mine!
what's mine! what's mine!
give me back what's mine!
today, we stood on the wall
we laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
we laughed at it all
and when they, they told us to go
we paid them no mind like every other time
but little did we know
i've seen the blood, i've seen the broken
the lost and the sights unseen
i want a flood, i want an ocean
to wash my confusion clean
i can't resolve this empty story
i can't repair the damage done
we are the fortunate ones
who've never faced oppression's gun
we are the fortunate ones
imitations of rebellion
we acted out, we wear the colors
confined by the things we own
we're not without, we're like each other
pretending we're here alone
and far away they burn their buildings
right in the face of the damage done
we are the fortunate ones
who've never faced oppression's gun
we are the fortunate ones
imitations of rebellion
rebellion
rebellion
rebellion
rebellion, rebellion
we lost before the start
rebellion, rebellion
one by one, we fall apart
we fall apart
we fall apart
we fall apart
we are the fortunate ones
who've never faced oppression's gun
we are the fortunate ones
imitations of, imitations of...
we are the fortunate ones
who've never faced oppression's gun
we are the fortunate ones
imitations of rebellion
rebellion
rebellion
rebellion
let me apologize to begin with
let me apologize for what i'm about to say
but trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed
and somehow, i got caught up in between
let me apologize to begin with
let me apologize for what i'm about to say
but trying to be someone else was harder than it seemed
and somehow, i got caught up in between
between my pride and my promise
between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
the things i want to say to you get lost before they come
the only thing that's worse than one is none
let me apologize to begin with
let me apologize for what i'm about to say
but trying to regain your trust was harder than it seemed

the things i want to say to you get lost before they come
the only thing that's worse than one is none
the only thing that's worse than one is none
and i cannot explain to you
in anything i say or do or plan
fear is not afraid of you
guilt's a language you can understand
i cannot explain to you, in anything i say or do
i hope the actions speak the words they can
for my pride and my promise

this is war with no weapons, marching with no stepping
murder with no killing, illing every direction
first, no sequel, do the math, no equal
john with no yoko; more power, less people
and no, i'm not afraid of that, print it in your paperback
every rap is made in fact to act as a delayed attack
every phrase a razor blade that's saved until they play it back
to slay and leave 'em laying on the pavement, bang, fade to black
in the wastelands of today
when there's nothing left to lose
and there's nothing more to take
but you force yourself to choose
in the wastelands of today
where tomorrow disappears
while the future slips away
and your hope turns into fear
in the wastelands of today
roll credits, you get it, the show is done
they're talking for just talking, but meaning, they got none
none of 'em come proper, they talk like a shotgun
but how many got bred with integrity? not one
so no, i'm not afraid to see you suckers hold a blade to me
ain't no way to shake the ground i built before you came to be
take it how you take it, i'm the opposite of vacancy
and this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see
in the wastelands of today
when there's nothing left to lose
and there's nothing more to take
but you force yourself to choose
in the wastelands of today
where tomorrow disappears
while the future slips away
and your hope turns into fear
and your hope turns into fear
in the wastelands of today
in the wastelands of today
when there's nothing left to lose
and there's nothing more to take
but you force yourself to choose
in the wastelands of today
where tomorrow disappears
while the future slips away
and your hope turns into fear
and your hope turns into fear
in the wastelands of today
in the wastelands of today
in the wastelands of today
like shining oil, this night is dripping down
stars are slipping down, glistening
and i'm trying not to think what i'm leaving, now
no deceiving now, it's time you let me know
let me know
when the lights go out and we open our eyes
out there in the silence, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
this air between us is getting thinner now
into winter now, bittersweet
and 'cross that horizon, this sun is setting down
you're forgetting now, it's time you let me go
let me go
when the lights go out and we open our eyes
out there in the silence, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
and tell them i couldn't help myself
and tell them i was alone
oh, tell me i am the only one
and there's nothing left to stop me
when the lights go out and we open our eyes
out there in the silence, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow, i'll be gone, i'll be gone, i'll be gone
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
you say you're not gonna fight
'cause no one will fight for you
and you think there's not enough love
and no one to give it to
and you're sure you've hurt for so long
you've got nothing left to lose
so, you say you're not gonna fight
'cause no one will fight for you
you say the weight of the world
has kept you from letting go
and you think compassion's a flaw
and you'll never let it show
and you're sure you've hurt in a way
that no one will ever know
but someday, the weight of the world
will give you the strength to go
whoa-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh
da-yeah-nah, no-ooh-oh
no, no
hold on, the weight of the world (na, no, no, no, no oh)
(oh-ho, yeah, yeah, yeah)
will give you the strength to go (yeah, yeah, aah)
(yeah, no)
so hold on, the weight of the world (yeah-aah, yeah, yeah)
will give you the strength to go (nah, ha, ha, ha) (no-oh, no-oh)
(ha ha ha ha, yah, yah, yah) (no-oh, no-oh)
(no-oh)
so hold on, the weight of the world (ah, yeah)
will give you the strength to go (mah, mah, mah)
(oh god, oh god, oh god)
just hold on, the weight of the world
will give you the strength to go
i come to this magnificent house of worship tonight
because my conscience leaves me no other choice
a true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order
and say of war;
"this way of settling differences is not just
this business of burning human beings with napalm
of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows
of injecting poisonous drugs of hate
into the veins of peoples normally humane
of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields
physically handicapped and psychologically deranged
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"

i'mma be that nail in your coffin
saying that i softened, i was ducking down to reload
so you can save your petty explanations
i don't have the patience; before you even say it, i know
you let your pride or your ego talk slick to me, no
that is not the way i get down
and look at how you lose your composure
now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds
i want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
what is it you want me to tell you?
i'm not the failure, i would rather live and let be
but you came with the right kind of threat to
push me to let you know you can't intimidate me
you disrespect me so clearly, now you better hear me
that is not the way it goes down
you did it to yourself and it's over
now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds
i want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
you did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
you did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
you did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
you did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
i want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
suffer all alone in your misery
drop like "get up", take to the streets
better lock that kid up, face full of teeth
when he hock that spit up, pacing the beat like a beast
rocking the block on repeat
speak from the cut like a rush of blood
paint red on the sleeves of the ones you love
lay the sick ones down and the bells will ring
put pennies on the eyes, let the dead men sing
i shiver and shake the warm air cold
i'm alone on my own
in every mistake, i dig this hole
through my skin and bones
it’s harder starting over
than never to have changed
with blackbirds following me
i'm digging out my grave
they close in, swallowing me
the pain, it comes in waves
i'm getting back what i gave
i sweat through the sheet as daylight fades
as i waste away
it traps me inside mistakes i've made
that's the price i pay
it’s harder starting over
than never to have changed
with blackbirds following me
i'm digging out my grave
they close in, swallowing me
the pain, it comes in waves
i'm getting back what i gave
i drop to the floor like i did before
stop watching, i'm coughing, i can't be more
what i want and what i need are at constant war
like a well full of poison, a rotten core
the blood goes thin, the fever stings
and i shake from the hell that the habits bring
let the sick ones down, the bells will ring
put pennies on the eyes, let the dead men sing
blackbirds following me
i'm digging out my grave
they close in, swallowing me
the pain, it comes in waves
i'm getting back what i gave
i'm getting back what i gave
i'm getting back what i gave
folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight
i'd like to introduce...
mr. hahn
let's hear it for the great (mr. hahn)
and now for a lesson in rhythm management
let's begin
alright now, wasn't that fun?
let's try something else
skin to bone, steel to rust
ash to ashes, dust to dust
let tomorrow have its way
with the promises we made
skin to bone, steel to rust
ash to ashes, dust to dust
your deception, my disgust
when your name is finally drawn
i'll be happy that you're gone
ash to ashes, dust to dust
ah, ash to ashes, dust to dust
ah, skin to bone and steel to rust
right to left, left to right
night to day and day to night
as the starlight fades to grey
i'll be marching far away
right to left and left to right
ah, ash to ashes, dust to dust
ah, skin to bone and steel to rust
let tomorrow have its way
with the promises betrayed
skin to bone and steel to rust
skin to bone and steel to rust
skin to bone and steel to rust
one, two
one, two, thank you
there's no peace, only war
victory decides who's wrong or right
it will not cease, only grow
you better be prepared to fight
and it will not apologize
for laying down your life
war
there's no pain, it will spare
fear has become your only right
and once you're lost, in your despair
forever black eternal night
and it will not apologize
for laying down your life
war, destroyer
war, destroyer
it needs no side to justify
laying down your life
war, destroyer
war

i've seen her smiling
the sunlight shining on her now
she couldn't stay here
she knows you won't let her down
you know she couldn't stay here with you
you know she had to go
even though she couldn't stay here with you
you know you're not alone
no matter what you think you did wrong
(won't be long 'til everybody knows)

she wouldn't stay here
she knows you won't let her down
you know she couldn't stay here with you
you know she had to go
even though she couldn't stay here with you
you know you're not alone
no matter what you think you did wrong

there's a fragile game we play
with the ghosts of yesterday
if we can't let go, we'll never say goodbye
no trace of what remains
no stones to mark the graves
only memories we thought we could deny
there was so much more to lose
than the pain i put you through
in my carelessness, i left you in the dark
and the blood may wash away
but the scars will never fade
at least i know, somehow, i made a mark
in the dark, in the light
nothing left, nothing right
in the dark, in the light
nothing left, nothing right
in the dark, in the light
nothing left, nothing right
in the dark, in the light
nothing left, nothing right!
nothing right!
nothing right!
we knew the world would not be the same
few people laughed, few people cried, most people were silent
i remember the line from the hindu scripture, the bhagavad-gita
vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says:
"now i am become death, the destroyer of worlds"
i suppose we all thought that, one way or another
no regret for the confidence betrayed
no more hiding in shadow
'cause i won't wait for the debt to be repaid
time has come for you
victimized, victimized
never again victimized
victimized, victimized
never again victimized
they're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot i'll give 'em
as the siren climbs higher on this violent rhythm
for you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
i ain't scared of your teeth, i admire what's in 'em
you been waiting in the shadows there, thinking you're hidden
but the truth is, you don't have the stomach to get 'em
go on already, hit 'em, yeah, you gotta be kidding
wanna talk about a victim? i'mma put you there with 'em
victimized, victimized
never again victimized
victimized, victimized
never again victimized
no
just do something to tell you who i am, you know?

i've been digging into crates ever since i was living in space
before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
mastered numerology and big bang theology
performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
invented the mic so i could start blessing it
and chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
many men have tried to shake us
but i twist mic chords to double helixes
and show them what i'm made of
i buckle knees like leg braces
cast the spell of instrumentalness on all of the mc's that hate us
so try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
from now to infinity, let icons be bygones
i firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
i tried threats, but moved on to a promise
i stomp shit, with or without an accomplice

put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
never satisfy my rhyme jones
spraying bright day over what you might say
blood type krylon, technicolor type a
on highways, bright with road rage
i'm patient to win, the cage and the tin to bounce all around
in surround sound, devouring the scene
subliminal gangrene paintings, overall, the same thing
sing-song karaoke copy madness
break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
fourth dimension combat convention
write rhymes at ease while the tracks stands at attention
(attention!)
meant to put you away with the pencil pistol, official
sixteen-line, rhyme missile
while you risk your all, i pick out of your flaws
spitting raw blah blah blah, you can say you saw

your lies!
yeah!
i didn't think that i had a debt to pay
'til they came to take all i had left away
you said you wouldn't put me to the test today
but i remember you saying that yesterday
there was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole
another lie hard to follow 'til it followed you home
and like that
broken down
a victim of your lies
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you crossed the line
wrapped up inside your lies
you hide behind lies
you're lost inside that cold disguise
behind your lies
i don't know what you thought i might say
seems like we never would talk the right way
every other minute i fought for my place
and drop what i made thought and you might stay so
i'm guessing that you probably know
when your inside's hollow then you ought to be cold
like a pill i couldn't swallow and it swallowed me whole
another lie hard to follow 'til it followed me home
and like that
broken down
a victim of your lies
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you crossed the line
wrapped up inside your lies
you hide behind lies
you're lost inside that cold disguise
behind your lies
you're faking, you're mistaken
if you think that you could climb out of this hole
forsaken, what we take when
all our lies come from the power of control
broken down
a victim of your lies
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you hide behind
wrapped up inside your lies
you hide behind lies
you don't know why
you crossed the line
wrapped up inside your lies
you hide behind lies
you're lost inside that cold disguise
behind your lies
standing alone with no direction
how did i fall so far behind?
why am i searching for perfection
knowing it's something i won't find?
in my fear and flaws
i let myself down, again
all because
i run 'til the silence splits me open
i run 'til it puts me underground
'til i have no breath
and no roads left but one
when did i lose my sense of purpose?
can i regain what's lost inside?
why do i feel like i deserve this?
why does my pain look like my pride?
in my fear and flaws
i let myself down, again
all because i let myself down
in my fear and flaws
i run 'til the silence splits me open
i run 'til it puts me underground
'til i have no breath
and no roads left but one
no roads left but one
in my fear and flaws
i let myself down, again
all because
i run and the silence splits me open
i run and it puts me underground
but there's no regret
and no roads left to run
yo...
watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
mixed media slang banging in your boom box
verbal violence, lyrical stylist
in a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish
you can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
rapping to a beat doesn't make you an mc
with your lack of skill and facility, you're killing me
and a dj in the group just for credibility
i heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
you're not an mc if someone else writes your lines
rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
‘cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years
but now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
all after a fast buck, and all the tracks suck
so how does it stack up? none of it's real
you want to be an mc, you've got to study the skill
who can rock a rhyme like this?
bring it to you every time like this?
who can rock a rhyme like this?
step, step up! step, step up!
so, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
but mentally, you don't have the hip hop energy
with a tendency to make up stories (bullshit)
sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40
and your record company is completely missing it
all the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
so in a battle, you can't hack it, react with whack shit
and get smacked with verbal back flips
get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
it's taken decades for mc's to establish this
you're new to hip-hop, and welcome if your serious
but not on the mic, leave that to the experienced
using the waves of sound
the true master paralyzes his opponents
leaving him vulnerable to attack
who can rock a rhyme like this?
bring it to you every time like this?
who can rock a rhyme like this?
step, step up! step, step up!
after years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists
we here at the sound institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system
actual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body
and the question must be asked…
who can rock a rhyme like this?
bring it to you every time like this?
who can rock a rhyme like this?
step, step up! step, step up!
who can rock a rhyme like this?
bring it to you every time like this?
who can rock a rhyme like this?

in this desert, in darkness
lying with the gun across his chest
pretending he's heartless
as the fire flashes in the sky
he was fragile and frozen
when the bullet took away his friend
and now he's somehow more broken
he's pulling his weapon to his side
loading it full of his goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
he's pulling his weapon to his side
loading it full of his goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
sweating and shaking
lying with her hands across her chest
she wakes with her cravings
as the fire flashes in her eye
she was fragile and frozen
when the needle took away her friend
but now she's somehow more broken
she's pulling her weapon to her side
loading it full of her goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
she's pulling her weapon to her side
loading it full of her goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
with every battle he's chosing
with every fight he's losing
his enemy's not far behind
with every promise she's broken
with every lie she's spoken
her enemy's not far behind
it's your time
it's your time
it's your time
it's your time!
he's pulling his weapon to his side
loading it full of his goodbyes
holding an enemy across the line
she's pulling her weapon to her side

i'm swimming in the smoke
of bridges i have burned
so, don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
the blame is mine, alone
for bridges i have burned
so, don't apologize
i'm losing what i don't deserve
what i don't deserve
"todos los pelotones, presten atención ahora mismo!"
i break down, fear is sinking in
the cold comes, racing through my skin
searching for a way to get to you through the storm
you go, giving up your home
go, leaving all you’ve known, you are not alone
with arms up, stretched into the sky
with eyes like echoes in the night
hiding from the hell that you’ve been through, silent one
you go, giving up your home
go, leaving all you’ve known
you go, giving up your home
go, leaving all you’ve known, you are not alone
you go, giving up your home
go, leaving all you’ve known
you go, giving up your home
go, you are not unknown, you are not alone
you are not unknown, you are not alone
where should i start? disjointed heart
i've got no commitment to my own flesh and blood
left all alone, far from my home
no one to hear me, to heal my ill heart
i keep it locked up, inside
i cannot express to the point i've regressed
if anger's a gift, then i guess i've been blessed
i keep it locked up, inside
keep my distance from your lies
it's too late to love me, now
you have never shown me
it's too late to love me, now
you don't even know me
breaking a part of my heart to find release
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
breaking a part of my heart to find release
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
breaking a part of my heart to find release (break!)
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (me!)
breaking a part of my heart to find release (down!)
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
keep it locked up, inside
keep my distance from your lies
breaking a part of my heart to find release (break!)
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (me!)
breaking a part of my heart to find release (down!)
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
breaking a part of my heart to find release
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
breaking a part of my heart to find release
taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
keep my distance
keep my distance
keep my distance
keep my distance
spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
dog paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
with my thought catalog, analogue rap battle log
keep my distance and fear resistance
hurt by persistence, the twisted web of tangled lies
strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
and i'm forced to face these hate crimes
against the state of being
feeling the weightlessness press me to the ceiling
reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
tuned to the frequency making your chest shake
with every boom
involuntary muscle contraction
ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
the sound pounds to make the dead flush
to hand you a head rush with read thoughts and said stuff
she can't hide, no matter how hard she tries
her secret disguise behind the lies
and at night, she cries away her pride
with eyes shut tight, staring at her inside
all her friends know why she can't sleep at night
all her family asking if she's alright
all she wants to do is get rid of this hell
well, all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself
she can only fool herself for so long
she can only fool herself for so long
she can only fool herself for so long
(i'm too weak to face me!) she can only fool herself
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
when it comes to how to live his life, he can't be told
says he's got it all under control
thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with
but in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit
an addict and he can't hold the reigns
the pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
tries to slow down the problem he's got
but can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop
he can only fool himself for so long
he can only fool himself for so long
he can only fool himself for so long
(i'm too weak to face me!) he can only fool himself
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
fly with me, under the wings i gave you
try to be closer to me and i'll save you
fly with me, under the wings i gave you
try to be closer to me and i'll save you
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
i never know just why you run
so far away, far away from me
part of me won't go away
everyday, reminded how much i hate it
weighed it against the consequences
can't live without it, so it‘s senseless
wanna cut it out of my soul
and just live with the gaping hole
take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste
i made the problems in the first place
hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
you hardly see right next to the heart of me
hurting me, wounds soon scar
new cuts cover where the old ones are
and now i'm sick of this
i can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
i rather not even be
than the man that's staring in the mirror through me
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
i feel it everyday
i feel i made my way
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
(freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it)
once it's been dealt with
you feel like you've been touched by something angelic
and then melted down into a pool of peace
cease to be the animal you used to be
remove the broken parts you know were wrong
and feel the calm when the problem's all gone
and then you start to see another piece
of yourself that you can't let be
memories of the last fight to free yourself
taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
and now you know you can choose
to lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise
you can live if you're willing to
put a stop to just what's killing you!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me!
i feel it everyday
i feel i made my way
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
(alive in me, inside of me
a part of me screams away silently
alive in me, inside of me
a part of me screams away silently)
this part of me won't go away! (alive in me, inside of me)
(a part of me screams away silently)
part of me won't go away! (alive in me, inside of me)
(a part of me screams away silently)
everywhere i look around, i see how everything ought to be
every time i see myself, there's always something wrong with me
everywhere i look around, i see how everything ought to be
every time i see myself, there's always something wrong with me
i feel it everyday
i feel i made my way
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
i feel it everyday
i feel i made my way
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
i feel it swell up inside
swell up inside, swallowing me
 loatr
i dreamed i was missing, you were so scared
but no-one would listen, 'cause no-one else cared
after my dreaming, i woke with this fear
what am i leaving, when i'm done here?
 loatr
so, if you're asking me, i want you to know
 loatr
when my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
don't resent me and, when you're feeling empty
keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
 sotd
i close both locks below the window
i close both blinds and turn away
sometimes solutions aren't so simple
sometimes goodbye's the only way
 sotd
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you
 sotd
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you

do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go. let it go
do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
you build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
remember all the sadness and frustration
